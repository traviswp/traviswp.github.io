Personal website built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/),
inspired by the [Much-Worse](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/much-worse/) and [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/) Jekyll themes,
and freely hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Quick-Start Guide

Simply clone/fork this repository, and then run `jekyll serve` inside the directory.
Note that to work on the files locally, you'll need to have this repo stored locally on your machine.
Your site should be up and running locally at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

After you've verified that you can serve the website locally,
edit the site attributes in `_config.yml` and edit the various entries in `_data/`, `_includes/`, and `_posts/` to your liking.
If you push to github, your website should be ready immediately at 'http://USERNAME.github.io'.

In the `_posts` directory you'll find some of my posts as well as good reference posts that I've kept around from the themes that inspired my site.
You can simply just duplicate the template post and start adding your own content.
