My research confronts issues with (in)security within computer systems and wireless networks.
My recent work has
    developed designs, techniques, and tools to harden software and systems in ways that mitgate common threats (e.g., malware);
    and introduced new techniques to detect and mitigate threats within Bluetooth-based wireless networks.

Before joining Include Security,
    I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the [Gianforte School of Computing](https://www.cs.montana.edu) at [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu).
<!-- Before joining MSU, -->
And before that, I received my PhD from [Dartmouth](https://dartmouth.edu) (2019),
    where I was advised by [Dr. David Kotz](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/).
My dissertation work was in the area of security for mobile systems and networks,
    particuarly the improvement of security and trust in Wireless Personal Area Networks.
I obtained my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://cse.wwu.edu/computer-science) and [Mathematics](https://cse.wwu.edu/mathematics) from [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu) (2012).
I also spent two summers working in the Security and Privacy Research Lab at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) (2015 and 2016).
