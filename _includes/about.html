Hi! I am **{{ site.data.settings.author }}**, ~~an n^th year PhD student at [Dartmouth](https://dartmouth.edu)~~
an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the [Gianforte School of Computing](https://www.cs.montana.edu) at [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu).
<!-- I'm also the Director of Cybersecurity at a healthcare start-up, clinicIQ.  -->


My research confronts issues with (in)security within computer systems and wireless networks.
My recent work has
    developed designs, techniques, and tools to harden software and systems in ways that mitgate common threats (e.g., malware);
    and introduced new techniques to detect and mitigate threats within Bluetooth-based wireless networks.

Before joining MSU,
    I received my PhD from [Dartmouth](https://dartmouth.edu) (2019),
    where I was advised by [Dr. David Kotz](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/).
My dissertation work was in the area of security for mobile systems and networks,
    particuarly the improvement of security and trust in Wireless Personal Area Networks.
<!-- While at Dartmouth,
    I was a member of the [Trustworthy Health & Wellness (THaW)](https://thaw.org/) project
        where I worked on exploring research problems in mobile and wearable computing, trustworthy I/O, and IoT security and privacy.
    I was also a member of the [Amulet](https://amulet-project.org/) project where I worked on the design of a low-power and secure wearable device,
        as well as a software framework that enables developers to create safe, secure, and efficient mobile health applications. -->
I obtained my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://cse.wwu.edu/computer-science) and [Mathematics](https://cse.wwu.edu/mathematics) from [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu) (2012).
I also spent two summers working in the Security and Privacy Research Lab at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) (2015 and 2016).

> Note: We are building a **world-class security research** group at Montana State University.
> If you are a motivated student with an interest in security, I would be interested in speaking with you.

> Note: I am teaching **[Operating Systems (CSCI 460)](https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs460/)** this term.
Office hours are Monday, Wednesday, Friday (9-10am) in NAH 253A.
