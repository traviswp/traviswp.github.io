Hi! I'm **{{ site.data.settings.author }}**, an n^th year PhD student at [Dartmouth](https://dartmouth.edu).
I am advised by [Dr. David Kotz](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/).

I work with others on researching security and privacy issues in computer systems and wireless communications.
I'm currently a member of the [Trustworthy Health & Wellness (THaW)](https://thaw.org/) project where I'm exploring research problems in physical computing, secure I/O, and IoT security and privacy.
I'm also a former member of the [Amulet](https://amulet-project.org/) project where I worked on the design of a low-power and secure wearable device,
as well as a software framework that enables developers to create safe, secure, and efficient mobile health applications.
