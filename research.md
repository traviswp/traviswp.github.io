I’m interested in (in)security, particularly at the lower levels of systems and wireless communications.
I’ve spent a great deal of time studying operating systems and trusted hardware (SGX and TrustZone in particular).
I became interested in these topics more as I began studying solutions for realizing secure I/O capabilities that can work with these trusted hardware features.
To that end, I’ve been particularly interested in wireless I/O devices such as those that connect with, for example, mobile devices such as smartphones over Bluetooth.
I’m increasingly interested in the existence of physical side channels — both understanding the attacks that exist because of them, as well as how they can be used to solve problems.

Ultimately, all of this ties into work that myself and my group have been doing around security- and privacy-oriented problems in the mobile healthcare domain.
Our focus is increasingly shifting towards a broader IoT security agenda.
