I’m interested in (in)security, particularly at the lower levels of systems and wireless communications.
I’ve spent a great deal of time studying operating systems and trusted hardware (SGX and TrustZone in particular).
I became interested in these topics more as I began studying solutions for realizing secure I/O capabilities that can work with these trusted hardware features.
To that end, I’ve been particularly interested in wireless I/O devices such as those that connect with, for example, mobile devices such as smartphones over Bluetooth.
I’m increasingly interested in the existence of physical side channels — both understanding the attacks that exist because of them, as well as how they can be used to solve problems.

Ultimately, all of this ties into work that myself and my group have been doing around security- and privacy-oriented problems in the mobile healthcare domain.
Our focus is increasingly shifting towards a broader IoT security agenda.

In response to the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) - and all of the challenges
that ensue - my advisor and I co-authored a paper that appeared in the proceedings of SafeThings (2017).
In this paper, we describe many issues in the realization of IoT,
and provide thoughts about how we - the community of security researchers - can
proceed in addressing these issues.

- Challenges/Life-Cycle Security, Privacy, and Safety of Things

Many of the most critical issues in security are focused around the security
of applications and user data - particularly sensitive data such as
login credentials (usernames, passwords, emails),
financial information (credit/debit card numbers, financial history), and
personal health information (PHI) (data sent to/from electronic health records).  
In response to these issues, we've addressed some of the most pressing
open problem in our recent work.
