I strongly believe that teaching doesn't just happen in the classroom.
Teaching is really about connecting with people and meeting them where they are at.
Over the years I've had opportunities to lead, teach, coach, and mentor in a multitude of capacities, including:

* Coaching distance runners for a local high school Track & Field team,
* Organizing workshops to engage graduate students and teach them about teaching and mentoring undergraduates,
* Teaching Sunday school classes with kids ranging from pre-school through middle school,
* Tutoring undergraduates and high school students in one-on-one and small group settings,
* Volunteering at tech recycling facilities and training other volunteers about computer components, assembly, cleaning, and basic diagnostic testing,
* Leading small discussion groups for my church, and
* Mentoring elementary-aged kids as a Big Brother.

Throughout my time at Western and Dartmouth I have also pursued (and greatly enjoyed!)
    more traditional academic teaching and mentoring opportunities.
