Strength training can mitigate the development of sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass or strength and function with aging. Yet, the adherence of such behavioral exercise strategies in a home-based setting is fraught with issues of monitoring and compliance. Our group developed a Bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band capable of transmitting data to an open-source platform. In this work, we developed an application to capture this information in real-time and conducted three usability studies in two mixed-aged groups of participants (n=6 each) and a group of older adults with obesity participating in a weight-loss intervention (n=20). The system was favorable, acceptable and provided iterative information that could assist in future deployment on ubiquitous platforms. Our formative work provides the foundation to deliver home-based monitoring interventions in a high-risk, older adult population.</div></div></div>

It is increasingly possible for individuals to wear devices that can sense their physiology or health-related behaviors, collecting valuable data in support of diagnosis, treatment, public health, or other applications. From a researcher’s point of view, the commercial availability of these “mHealth” devices has made it feasible to conduct scientific studies of health conditions and to explore health-related interventions. It remains difficult, however, to conduct systems work or other experimental research involving the hardware, software, security, and networking aspects of mobile and wearable technology. In this paper we describe the <strong>Amulet</strong> platform, an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device designed specifically for mHealth applications. Our position is that the Amulet is an inexpensive platform for research and education, and we encourage the mHealth community to explore its potential.</div></div></div>

Ideally, JITAIs include effective intervention components, and delivery tailoring is based on effective moderators of intervention effects. Using machine learning techniques to infer each user’s context from smartphone sensor data is a promising approach to further enhance tailoring.Objective: The primary objective of this study is to quantify main effects, interactions, and moderators of 3 intervention components of a smartphone-based intervention for physical activity. The secondary objective is the exploration of participants’ states of receptivity, that is, situations in which participants are more likely to react to intervention notifications through collection of smartphone sensor data.Methods: In 2017, we developed the Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY (Ally), a chatbot-based mobile health intervention for increasing physical activity that utilizes incentives, planning, and self-monitoring prompts to help participants meet personalized step goals. We used a microrandomized trial design to meet the study objectives. Insurees of a large Swiss insurance company were invited to use the Ally app over a 12-day baseline and a 6-week intervention period. Upon enrollment, participants were randomly allocated to either a financial incentive, a charity incentive, or a no incentive condition. Over the course of the intervention period, participants were repeatedly randomized on a daily basis to either receive prompts that support self-monitoring or not and on a weekly basis to receive 1 of 2 planning interventions or no planning. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire at baseline and postintervention follow-up.Results: Data collection was completed in January 2018. In total, 274 insurees (mean age 41.73 years; 57.7% [158/274] female) enrolled in the study and installed the Ally app on their smartphones. Main reasons for declining participation were having an incompatible smartphone (37/191, 19.4%) and collection of sensor data (35/191, 18.3%). Step data are available for 227 (82.8%, 227/274) participants, and smartphone sensor data are available for 247 (90.1%, 247/274) participants.Conclusions: This study describes the evidence-based development of a JITAI for increasing physical activity. If components prove to be efficacious, they will be included in a revised version of the app that offers scalable promotion of physical activity at low cost.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03384550; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03384550 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/74IgCiK3d)International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/11540</div></div></div>

Although some phones support methods to ease the burden (such as fingerprint readers), these methods require active participation by the user and do not verify the user’s identity after the phone is unlocked. We propose CSAW, a continuous smartphone authentication method that leverages wristbands to verify that the phone is in the hands of its owner. In CSAW, users wear a wristband (a smartwatch or a fitness band) with built-in motion sensors, and by comparing the wristband’s motion with the phone’s motion, CSAW continuously produces a score indicating its confidence that the person holding (and using) the phone is the person wearing the wristband. This score provides the foundation for a wide range of authentication decisions (e.g., unlocking phone, deauthentication, or limiting phone access). Through two user studies (N=27,11) we evaluated CSAW’s accuracy, usability, and security. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that CSAW was able to conduct initial authentication with over 99% accuracy and continuous authentication with over 96.5% accuracy.</div></div></div>

In these cases, close physical proximity among devices that have never shared a secret key is sometimes used as a basis of trust; devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user’s device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques.We present theoretical and practical evaluation of a method called SNAP – SiNgle Antenna Proximity – that allows a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our proximity detection technique leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi’s preamble and the behavior of a signal in a transmitting antenna’s near-field region to detect proximity with high probability; SNAP never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.</div></div></div>

<div class='resource-container'><button class="btn btn-primary btn-xs abstract-btn" type="button" data-toggle="collapse">Abstract</button><div class="collapse well panel-body abstract-text-container">Secure communication is difficult to arrange between devices that have not previously shared a secret. Previous solutions to the problem are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, require additional hardware for out-of-band communication, or require an extensive public-key infrastructure. Furthermore, as the number of wireless devices explodes with the advent of the Internet of Things, it will be impractical to manually configure each device to communicate with its neighbors or with the local WLAN.Our system, <em>CloseTalker</em>CloseTalker, allows simple, secure, ad hoc communication between devices in close physical proximity, while jamming the signal so it is unintelligible to any receivers more than a few centimeters away. CloseTalker does not require any specialized hardware or sensors in the devices, does not require complex algorithms or cryptography libraries, occurs only when intended by the user, and can transmit a short burst of data or an address and key that can be used to establish long-term or long-range communications at full bandwidth.In this paper we present a theoretical and practical evaluation of CloseTalker, which exploits Wi-Fi MIMO antennas and the fundamental physics of radio to establish secure communication between devices that have never previously met. We demonstrate that CloseTalker is able to facilitate secure in-band communication between devices in close physical proximity (about 5 cm), even though they have never met nor shared a key.</div></div></div>

Older adults present unique challenges in advancing new models of health promotion using technology including sensory limitations and less experience with mHealth, underscoring the need for specialized usability testing. We use an open-source mHealth device as a case example for its integration in a newly designed health services intervention. We performed a convergent, parallel mixed-methods study including semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and questionnaires, using purposive sampling of 29 older adults, 4 community leaders, and 7 clinicians in a rural setting. We transcribed the data, developed codes informed by thematic analysis using inductive and deductive methods, and assessed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. Our results suggest the importance of end-users in user-centered design of mHealth devices and that aesthetics are critically important. The prototype could potentially be feasibly integrated within health behavior interventions. Centralized dashboards were desired by all participants and ecological momentary assessment could be an important part of monitoring. Concerns of mHealth, including the prototype device, include the device’s accuracy, its intrusiveness in daily life and privacy. Formative evaluations are critically important prior to deploying large-scale interventions.</div></div></div>

More specifically, in free-living conditions, we can recognize when and for how long a person is eating. Using an off-the-shelf contact microphone placed behind the ear, Auracle captures the sound of a person chewing as it passes through the bone and tissue of the head. This audio data is then processed by a custom analog/digital circuit board. To ensure reliable (yet comfortable) contact between microphone and skin, all hardware components are incorporated into a 3D-printed behind-the-head framework. We collected field data with 14 participants for 32 hours in free-living conditions and additional eating data with 10 participants for 2 hours in a laboratory setting. We achieved accuracy exceeding 92.8% and F1 score exceeding 77.5% for eating detection. Moreover, Auracle successfully detected 20-24 eating episodes (depending on the metrics) out of 26 in free-living conditions. We demonstrate that our custom device could sense, process, and classify audio data in real time. Additionally, we estimate Auracle can last 28.1 hours with a 110 mAh battery while communicating its observations of eating behavior to a smartphone over Bluetooth.</div></div></div>

In this work, we present GeriActive, an application on the Amulet wrist-worn device that monitors in real time older adults’ daily activity levels (low, moderate and vigorous), which we categorized using metabolic equivalents (METs). The app implements an activity-level detection model we developed using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). We trained our model using data from volunteer subjects (n=29) who performed common physical activities (sit, stand, lay down, walk and run) and obtained an accuracy of 94.3% with leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation. We ran a week-long field study to evaluate the usability and battery life of the GeriActive system where 5 older adults wore the Amulet as it monitored their activity level. Their feedback showed that our system has the potential to be usable and useful. Our evaluation further revealed a battery life of at least 1 week. The results are promising, indicating that the app may be used for activity-level monitoring by individuals or researchers for health delivery interventions that could improve the health of older adults.</div></div></div>

These platforms typically use microcontrollers that lack sophisticated Memory Management Units (MMU). Some include a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), but current MPUs are inadequate to the task, leading platform developers to software-based memory-protection solutions. In this paper, we present our memory isolation technique, which leverages compiler inserted code and MPU-hardware support to achieve better runtime performance than software-only counterparts.</div></div></div>

The resulting data may be used directly by a consumer, or shared with a clinician for treatment, a caregiver for assistance, or a health coach for support. The data can also be used by researchers to develop and evaluate just-in-time interventions that leverage mobile technology to help individuals manage their symptoms and behavior in real time and as needed. Such wearable systems have huge potential for promoting delivery of anywhere-anytime health care, improving public health, and enhancing the quality of life for many people. The Center for Technology and Behavioral Health at Dartmouth College, a P30 “Center of Excellence” supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, conducted a workshop in February 2017 on innovations in emerging technology, user-centered design, and data analytics for behavioral health, with presentations by a diverse range of experts in the field. The workshop focused on wearable and mobile technologies being used in clinical and research contexts, with an emphasis on applications in mental health, addiction, and health behavior change. In this paper, we summarize the workshop panels on mobile sensing, user experience design, statistics and machine learning, and privacy and security, and conclude with suggested research directions for this important and emerging field of applying digital approaches to behavioral health. Workshop insights yielded four key directions for future research: (1) a need for behavioral health researchers to work iteratively with experts in emerging technology and data analytics, (2) a need for research into optimal user-interface design for behavioral health technologies, (3) a need for privacy-oriented design from the beginning of a novel technology, and (4) the need to develop new analytical methods that can scale to thousands of individuals and billions of data points.</div></div></div>

However, wearables are small and have limited user interfaces, hence they often wirelessly interface with a personal smartphone or a personal computer to relay information from the wearable for display or other interactions. In this paper, we envision a new method by which a wearable can establish a secure connection to an ambient display, such as a television or computer monitor, based on the user’s intention to connect to the display. The user can access and display the bracelet’s information without having to carry personal display devices. Such connections must only be made intentionally, must be secure to prevent impersonation attacks, must work with unmodified display hardware, and must be easy to establish even when a new display is encountered. We propose a secure wearable/display connection solution, named LightTouch. LightTouch uses standard RF methods (like Bluetooth) for communicating the data to display, securely bootstrapped with a key shared via a brightness channel between the low cost, low power, ambient light sensor of a wearable and the screen of the display. A screen touch gesture is adopted by users to ensure the modulation of screen brightness can be accurately and securely captured by the ambient light sensor. Wireless coordination with the processor driving the display establishes a shared secret based on the brightness channel information. We further propose novel on-screen localization and correlation algorithms to improve security and reliability. Through experiments we demonstrate that LightTouch is compatible with current display and wearable designs, easy-to-use (5-6 seconds), reliable for connecting multiple displays in various ambient light conditions (98% success connection ratio), and secure against impersonation attacks. Our solution should also work with many other mobile electronic devices.</div></div></div>

For many devices, it is critical to identify the wearer, allowing sensor data to be properly labeled or personalized behavior to be properly achieved. In this paper we propose the use of vocal resonance, that is, the sound of the person’s voice as it travels through the person’s body – a method we anticipate would be suitable for devices worn on the head, neck, or chest. In this regard, we go well beyond the simple challenge of speaker recognition: we want to know who is wearing the device. We explore two machine-learning approaches that analyze voice samples from a small throat-mounted microphone and allow the device to determine whether (a) the speaker is indeed the expected person, and (b) the microphone-enabled device is physically on the speaker’s body. We collected data from 29 subjects, demonstrate the feasibility of a prototype, and show that our DNN method achieved balanced accuracy 0.914 for identification and 0.961 for verification by using an LSTM-based deep-learning model, while our efficient GMM method achieved balanced accuracy 0.875 for identification and 0.942 for verification.</div></div></div>

For example, a user may get logged in when she is near a computer or just passing by, even if she does not intend to use that computer. Lack of user intentionality in proximity-based methods makes them less suitable for multi-user shared computer environments, despite their desired usability benefits over passwords.We present an authentication method for desktops called Seamless Authentication using Wristbands (SAW), which addresses the lack of intentionality limitation of proximity-based methods. SAW uses a low-effort user input step for explicitly conveying user intentionality, while keeping the overall usability of the method better than password-based methods. In SAW, a user wears a wristband that acts as the user’s identity token, and to authenticate to a desktop, the user provides a low-effort input by tapping a key on the keyboard multiple times or wiggling the mouse with the wristband hand. This input to the desktop conveys that someone wishes to log in to the desktop, and SAW verifies the user who wishes to log in by confirming the user’s proximity and correlating the received keyboard or mouse inputs with the user’s wrist movement, as measured by the wristband. In our feasibility user study (n=17), SAW proved quick to authenticate (within two seconds), with a low false-negative rate of 2.5% and worst-case false-positive rate of 1.8%. In our user perception study (n=16), a majority of the participants rated it as more usable than passwords.</div></div></div>

These sensors measure physiological signals of a person and are often bulky, custom-made, expensive, and/or in limited supply, hence limiting their large-scale adoption by researchers and the general public.

Yet, adherence to home-based regimens, which is a cornerstone to lifestyle therapies, is poor and cannot be ascertained by clinicians as no objective methods exist to determine patient compliance outside of a supervised setting. Our group developed a Bluetooth connected resistance band that tests the ability to detect exercise repetitions. We recruited 6 patients aged 65 years and older and recorded 4 specific, physical therapist-led exercises. Three blinded reviewers examined the findings and we also applied a peak finding algorithm to the data.

Collectively known as the Internet of Things (IoT), these newly communication-enabled devices are envisioned to collect and share data among themselves, with new devices entering and exiting a particular environment frequently. People and the devices they wear or carry may soon encounter dozens, possibly hundreds, of devices each day. Many of these devices will be encountered for the first time. Additionally, some of the information the devices share may have privacy or security implications. Furthermore, many of these devices will have limited or non-existent user interfaces, making manual configuration cumbersome. This situation suggests that devices that have never met, nor shared a secret, but that are in the same physical area, must have a way to securely communicate that requires minimal manual intervention. In this dissertation we present novel approaches to solve these short-range communication issues. Our techniques are simple to use, secure, and consistent with user intent. We first present a technique called Wanda that uses radio strength as a communication channel to securely impart information onto nearby devices. We focus on using Wanda to introduce new devices into an environment, but Wanda could be used to impart any type of information onto wireless devices, regardless of device type or manufacturer. Next we describe SNAP, a method for a single-antenna wireless device to determine when it is in close physical proximity to another wireless device. Because radio waves are invisible, a user may believe transmissions are coming from a nearby device when in fact the transmissions are coming from a distant adversary attempting to trick the user into accepting a malicious payload. Our approach significantly raises the bar for an adversary attempting such a trick. Finally, we present a solution called JamFi that exploits MIMO antennas and the Inverse-Square Law to securely transfer data between nearby devices while denying more distant adversaries the ability to recover the data. We find JamFi is able to facilitate reliable and secure communication between two devices in close physical proximity, even though they have never met nor shared a key.</div></div></div>

In these cases, devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user’s device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques. We investigate a method for a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our approach leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi’s preamble and the characteristics of a transmitting antenna’s near field to detect proximity with high probability. Our method never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.</div></div></div>

We demonstrate the device’s sensitivity to stress induction by providing descriptive statistics of 8 common EDA signal features for each stressor of the experiment.

In this paper, we evaluate sensors and algorithms designed to detect eating activities, more specifically, when people eat. We compare two popular methods for eating recognition (based on acoustic and electromyography (EMG) sensors) individually and combined. We built a data-acquisition system using two off-the-shelf sensors and conducted a study with 20 participants.

We trained and tested our model using data from three sources and had the following preliminary results: PhysioNet, a public physiological database (94.5% accurate with 10-fold cross validation), a field study (100% accurate with 10-fold cross validation) and a lab study (64.3% accurate with leave-one-out cross-validation).

We obtained accuracies up to 99.2 validation and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation respectively. We ran a week-long field study to evaluate the utility, usability and battery life of the ActivityAware system where 5 older adults wore the Amulet as it monitored their activity level. The utility evaluation showed that the app was somewhat useful in achieving the daily physical activity goal. The usability feedback showed that the ActivityAware system has the potential to be used by people for monitoring their activity levels. Our energy-efficiency evaluation revealed a battery life of at least 1 week before needing to recharge. The results are promising, indicating that the app may be used for activity-level monitoring by individuals or researchers for epidemiological studies, and eventually for the development of interventions that could improve the health of older adults.</div></div></div>

In this work, we present ActivityAware, an application on the Amulet wrist-worn device that measures daily activity levels (sedentary, moderate and vigorous) of individuals, continuously and in real-time. The app implements an activity-level detection model, continuously collects acceleration data on the Amulet, classifies the current activity level, updates the day’s accumulated time spent at that activity level, logs the data for later analysis, and displays the results on the screen.

In this paper, we introduce ShareABEL, a scalable, usable, and practical system that allows mHealth-data owners to specify access-control policies and to cryptographically enforce those policies so that only parties with the proper corresponding permissions are able to decrypt data. The design (and prototype implementation) of this system makes three contributions: (1) it applies cryptographically-enforced access-control measures to wearable healthcare data, which pose different challenges than Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), (2) it recognizes the temporal nature of mHealth data streams and supports revocation of access to part or all of a data stream, and (3) it departs from the vendor- and device-specific silos of mHealth data by implementing a secure end-to-end system that can be applied to data collected from a variety of mHealth apps and devices.</div></div></div>

Many forms of mHealth data are highly sensitive; in the hands of unintended parties such data may reveal indicators of a patient’s disorder, disability, or identity. Furthermore, if a malicious party tampers with the data, it can affect the diagnosis or treatment of patients, or the results of a research study. Although existing network protocols leverage encryption for confidentiality and integrity, network-level encryption does not provide end-to-end security from the device, through the smartphone and database, to downstream data consumers. In this thesis we provide a new open protocol that provides end-to-end authentication, confidentiality, and integrity for healthcare data in such a pipeline.We present and evaluate a prototype implementation to demonstrate this protocol’s feasibility on low-power wearable devices, and present a case for the system’s ability to meet critical security properties under a specific adversary model and trust assumptions.</div></div></div>

Many of these Things are embedded in the physical infrastructure, and like the infrastructure they are designed to last for decades – far longer than is normal with today’s electronic devices. What happens then, when an occupant moves out or transfers ownership of her Smart Environment? This paper outlines the critical challenges required for the safe long-term operation of Smart Environments. How does an occupant identify and decommission all the Things in an environment before she moves out? How does a new occupant discover, identify, validate, and configure all the Things in the environment he adopts? When a person moves from smart home to smart office to smart hotel, how is a new environment vetted for safety and security, how are personal settings migrated, and how are they securely deleted on departure? When the original vendor of a Thing (or the service behind it) disappears, how can that Thing (and its data, and its configuration) be transferred to a new service provider? What interface can enable lay people to manage these complex challenges, and be assured of their privacy, security, and safety? We present a list of key research questions to address these important challenges.</div></div></div>

Once logged in, user sessions may be vulnerable to imposter attacks in which an impostor steps up to the user’s unattended computer and inherits the user’s access privilege. We propose a ring-based authentication system called “AuthoRing”, which restricts the imposter attackers from generating new inputs at the computer’s mouse and keyboard. During the log-in process, an eligible AuthoRing user wears a digital ring with accelerometers and wireless communication capability. When input is detected at the mouse or keyboard, the computer’s AuthoRing system correlates hand-motion data received from the ring with the input data from the computer’s window manager, and detects imposter attacks when these data are insufficiently correlated. We implemented the AuthoRing system and evaluated its security, efficiency, and usability; we found that imposter attacks can be effectively detected and the required operations happen quickly with negligible delays experienced by the user.</div></div></div>

In this paper, we envision a new method, LightTouch, by which a wearable can establish a secure connection to an ambient display, such as a television or a computer monitor, while ensuring the user’s intention to connect to the display. LightTouch uses standard RF methods (like Bluetooth) for communicating the data to display, securely bootstrapped via the visible-light communication (the brightness channel) from the display to the low-cost, low-power, ambient light sensor of a wearable. A screen “touch” gesture is adopted by users to ensure that the modulation of screen brightness can be securely captured by the ambient light sensor with minimized noise. Wireless coordination with the processor driving the display establishes a shared secret based on the brightness channel information. We further propose novel on-screen localization and correlation algorithms to improve security and reliability. Through experiments and a preliminary user study we demonstrate that LightTouch is compatible with current display and wearable designs, is easy to use (about 6 seconds to connect), is reliable (up to 98% success connection ratio), and is secure against attacks.</div></div></div>

For our experiments, we analyze four different feature-selection algorithms and three different feature sets for speaker identification and speaker verification. Our results show that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with frequency-domain features had the highest accuracy, Pearson Correlation (PC) with time-domain features had the lowest energy use, and recursive feature elimination (RFE) with frequency-domain features had the least latency.

Being able to monitor when and why a person is stressed could inform personal stress management as well as interventions when necessary. In this thesis, I present StressAware, an application on the Amulet wearable platform to measure the stress levels of individuals continuously and in real time. The app implements a stress detection model, continuously streams heart rate data from a commercial heart-rate monitor such as a Zephyr and Polar H7, classifies the stress level of an individual, logs the stress level and then displays it as a graph on the screen. I developed a stress detection model using a Linear Support Vector Machine. I trained my classifiers using data from 3 sources: PhysioNet, a public database with various physiological data, a field study, where subjects went about their normal daily activities and a lab study in a controlled environment, where subjects were exposed to various stressors. I used 73 data segments of stress data obtained from PhysioNet, 120 data segments from the field study, and 14 data segments from the lab study. I extracted 14 heart rate and heart rate variability features. With 10-fold cross validation for Radial Basis Function (RBF) SVM, I obtained an accuracy of 94.5% for the PhysioNet dataset and 100% for the field study dataset. And for the lab study, I obtained an accuracy of 64.29% with leave-one-out cross-validation. Testing the StressAware app revealed a projected battery life of up to 12 days before needing to recharge. Also, the usability feedback from subjects showed that the Amulet and Zephyr have a potential to be used by people for monitoring their stress levels. The results are promising, indicating that the app may be used for stress detection, and eventually for the development of stress-related intervention that could improve the health of individuals.</div></div></div>

To achieve long battery life with a workload comprising apps from multiple developers, these platforms must have robust mechanisms for app isolation and developer tools for optimizing resource usage.We introduce the Amulet Platform for constrained wearable devices, which includes an ultra-low-power hardware architecture and a companion software framework, including a highly efficient event-driven programming model, low-power operating system, and developer tools for profiling ultra-low-power applications at compile time. We present the design and evaluation of our prototype Amulet hardware and software, and show how the framework enables developers to write energy-efficient applications. Our prototype has battery lifetime lasting weeks or even months, depending on the application, and our interactive resource-profiling tool predicts battery lifetime within 6-10% of the measured lifetime.</div></div></div>

This thesis describes architectural changes that improve the Amulet’s ability to receive data from a variety of BLE-enabled sensors and make it easier for developers to integrate new BLE-enabled sensors with the Amulet by introducing support for connecting to multiple sensors at the same time, rewriting the radio code to be more generic, and exposing BLE functionality to the AmuletOS. We discuss the relevant parts of the AmuletOS and the BLE protocol as background, describe the current structure of BLE communications on the Amulet, and document the proposed changes to create a system for easily integrating new BLE-enabled sensors and handling connections to multiple sensors simultaneously.</div></div></div>

Authentication is burdensome. When we wish to access to a computer or a resource, it is an additional task that we need to perform – an interruption in our workflow. In this dissertation, we study people’s authentication behavior and attempt to make authentication to desktops and smartphones less burdensome for users.First, we present the findings of a user study we conducted to understand people’s authentication behavior: things they authenticate to, how and when they authenticate, authentication errors they encounter and why, and their opinions about authentication. In our study, participants performed about 39 authentications per day on average; the majority of these authentications were to personal computers (desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet) and with passwords, but the number of authentications to other things (e.g., car, door) was not insignificant. We saw a high failure rate for desktop and laptop authentication among our participants, affirming the need for a more usable authentication method. Overall, we found that authentication was a noticeable part of all our participants’ lives and burdensome for many participants, but they accepted it as cost of security, devising their own ways to cope with it.Second, we propose a new approach to authentication, called bilateral authentication, that leverages wrist-wearable technology to enable seamless authentication for things that people use with their hands, while wearing a smart wristband. In bilateral authentication two entities (e.g., user’s wristband and the user’s phone) share their knowledge (e.g., about user’s interaction with the phone) to verify the user’s identity. Using this approach, we developed a seamless authentication method for desktops and smartphones. Our authentication method offers quick and effortless authentication, continuous user verification while the desktop (or smartphone) is in use, and automatic deauthentication after use. We evaluated our authentication method through four in-lab user studies, evaluating the method’s usability and security from the system and the user’s perspective. Based on the evaluation, our authentication method shows promise for reducing users’ authentication burden for desktops and smartphones.</div></div></div>

People may consider certain health information sensitive and prefer to disclose only what is necessary. In this dissertation, we present our findings about factors that affect people’s sharing behavior, describe scenarios in which people may wish to collect and share their personal health-related information with others, but may be hesitant to disclose the information if necessary controls are not available to protect their privacy, and propose frameworks to provide the desired privacy controls. We introduce the concept of close encounters that allow users to share data with other people who may have been in spatio-temporal proximity. We developed two smartphone-based systems that leverage stationary sensors and beacons to determine whether users are in spatio-temporal proximity. The first system, ENACT, allows patients diagnosed with a contagious airborne disease to alert others retrospectively about their possible exposure to airborne virus. The second system, SPICE, allows users to collect sensor information, retrospectively, from others with whom they shared a close encounter. We present design and implementation of the two systems, analyse their security and privacy guarantees, and evaluate the systems on various performance metrics. Finally, we evaluate how Bluetooth beacons and Wi-Fi access points can be used in support of these systems for close encounters, and present our experiences and findings from a deployment study on Dartmouth campus.</div></div></div>

Those schemes fail to provide continuous protection of the smartphone after the initial login. They also fail to meet the hierarchy of security requirements for different apps under different contexts. In this study, we propose a continuous and hierarchical authentication scheme. We believe that a user’s app-usage patterns depend on his location context. As such, our scheme relies on app-usage patterns in different location context to continuously establish the log probability density (LPD) of the authenticity of the current user. Based on different LPD thresholds corresponding to different security requirements, the current user either has a LPD higher than the threshold, which grants him continuous access to the phone or the app, or he has a LPD lower than the threshold, which locks him out of the phone or the app immediately. We test our scheme on 4,600 subjects from the Device Analyzer Dataset. We found that our scheme could correctly identify the authenticity of the majority of the subjects. However, app-usage patterns with or without location context yielded similar performances, indicating that user contexts did not contribute further information to establish user behavioral patterns. Based on our scheme, we propose a hypothetical Android app which would provide continuous and hierarchical authentication for the smartphone users.</div></div></div>

For example, one could leverage sensor-equipped vehicles to measure traffic or pollution levels on a particular street or users’ mobile phones to locate (Bluetooth-enabled) objects in their vicinity. In most proposed applications, context reports include the time and location of the event, putting the privacy of users at increased risk: even if identifying information has been removed from a report, the accompanying time and location can reveal sufficient information to de-anonymize the user whose device sent the report. We propose and evaluate a novel spatiotemporal blurring mechanism based on tessellation and clustering to protect users’ privacy against the system while reporting context. Our technique employs a notion of probabilistic k-anonymity; it allows users to perform local blurring of reports efficiently without an online anonymization server before the data are sent to the system. The proposed scheme can control the degree of certainty in location privacy and the quality of reports through a system parameter. We outline the architecture and security properties of our approach and evaluate our tessellation and clustering algorithm against real mobility traces.</div></div></div>

This paper addresses a method to achieve the latter, that is, for a wearable device to identify the wearer, allowing sensor data to be properly labeled or personalized behavior to be properly achieved. We use vocal resonance, that is, the sound of the person’s voice as it travels through the person’s body. By collecting voice samples from a small wearable microphone, our method allows the device to determine whether (a) the speaker is indeed the expected person, and (b) the microphone device is physically on the speaker’s body.

In this paper we address a portion of this vision by offering a wearable system that unobtrusively recognizes the person wearing it. Because it can recognize the user, our system can properly label sensor data or personalize interactions.Our recognition method uses bioimpedance, a measurement of how tissue responds when exposed to an electrical current. By collecting bioimpedance samples using a small wearable device we designed, our system can determine that (a)the wearer is indeed the expected person and (b) the device is physically on the wearer’s body. Our recognition method works with 98% balanced-accuracy under a cross-validation of a day’s worth of bioimpedance samples from a cohort of 8 volunteer subjects. We also demonstrate that our system continues to recognize a subset of these subjects even several months later. Finally, we measure the energy requirements of our system as implemented on a Nexus S smart phone and custom-designed module for the Shimmer sensing platform.</div></div></div>

One popular type of wearable devices are worn on human wrist and are equipped with sensors to passively perform sensing tasks. Their constrained user interface, however, is ineffective to display the sensory data for users. We envision connecting a wrist-worn device to a display device, such as a television, so the user is able to view the sensory data. Such connections must be secure to prevent the sensory data from being eavesdropped by other devices, must be made only when the user intends, and must be easy even when a new display is encountered (such as in a medical clinic, or a hotel room). In this presentation, we will discuss the secure wearable/display connection problem by revisiting existing methods and hardware designs of wrist-worn devices and display devices. We then present possible solutions that leverage the built-in hardware components of wrist-worn devices to implement, secure, intentional, easy connections to ambient display devices.</div></div></div>

Users often do not log out, however, which is a security risk. The most common solution, inactivity timeouts, inevitably fail security (too long a timeout) or usability (too short a timeout) goals. One solution is to authenticate users continuously while they are using the terminal and automatically log them out when they leave. Several solutions are based on user proximity, but these are not sufficient: they only confirm whether the user is nearby but not whether the user is actually using the terminal. Proposed solutions based on behavioral biometric authentication (e.g., keystroke dynamics) may not be reliable, as a recent study suggests.To address this problem we propose ZEBRA. In ZEBRA, a user wears a bracelet (with a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and radio) on her dominant wrist. When the user interacts with a computer terminal, the bracelet records the wrist movement, processes it, and sends it to the terminal. The terminal compares the wrist movement with the inputs it receives from the user (via keyboard and mouse), and confirms the continued presence of the user only if they correlate. Because the bracelet is on the same hand that provides inputs to the terminal, the accelerometer and gyroscope data and input events received by the terminal should correlate because their source is the same – the user’s hand movement. In our experiments ZEBRA performed continuous authentication with 85% accuracy in verifying the correct user and identified all adversaries within 11 s. For a different threshold that trades security for usability, ZEBRA correctly verified 90% of users and identified all adversaries within 50 s.</div></div></div>

In this report we provide a more detailed comparative evaluation of ZEBRA against other related authentication schemes. The abstract of the paper follows. Common authentication methods based on passwords, tokens, or fingerprints perform one-time authentication and rely on users to log out from the computer terminal when they leave. Users often do not log out, however, which is a security risk. The most common solution, inactivity timeouts, inevitably fail security (too long a timeout) or usability (too short a timeout) goals. One solution is to authenticate users continuously while they are using the terminal and automatically log them out when they leave. Several solutions are based on user proximity, but these are not sufficient: they only confirm whether the user is nearby but not whether the user is actually using the terminal. Proposed solutions based on behavioral biometric authentication (e.g., keystroke dynamics) may not be reliable, as a recent study suggests. To address this problem we propose ZEBRA. In ZEBRA, a user wears a bracelet (with a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and radio) on her dominant wrist. When the user interacts with a computer terminal, the bracelet records the wrist movement, processes it, and sends it to the terminal. The terminal compares the wrist movement with the inputs it receives from the user (via keyboard and mouse), and confirms the continued presence of the user only if they correlate. Because the bracelet is on the same hand that provides inputs to the terminal, the accelerometer and gyroscope data and input events received by the terminal should correlate because their source is the same – the user’s hand movement. In our experiments ZEBRA performed continuous authentication with 85% accuracy in verifying the correct user and identified all adversaries within 11 s. For a different threshold that trades security for usability, ZEBRA correctly verified 90% of users and identified all adversaries within 50 s.</div></div></div>

Using mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect data about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between sensors and electronic health record systems, caregivers can continuously monitor the patients and deliver better care. Furthermore, individuals can become better engaged in monitoring and managing their own health. Although some work on mHealth sensing has addressed security, achieving strong privacy for low-power sensors remains a challenge. We make three contributions. First, we propose an mHealth sensing protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties at the link layer, with low energy overhead, suitable for low-power sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive security, to dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery difficult even for small-sized Message Authentication Codes; and asymmetric resource requirements, in recognition of the limited resources in tiny mHealth sensors. Second, we demonstrate its feasibility by implementing a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and evaluating it experimentally. Third, we provide a security, privacy, and energy analysis of our system.</div></div></div>

However, none of the available mobile platforms provide the essential properties that are needed by these applications. An mHealth platform must be (i) secure; (ii) provide high availability; and (iii) allow for the deployment of multiple third-party mHealth applications that share access to an individual’s devices and data. Smartphones may not be able to provide property (ii) because there are activities and situations in which an individual may not be able to carry them (e.g., while in a contact sport). A low-power wearable device can provide higher availability, remaining attached to the user during most activities. Furthermore, some mHealth applications require integrating multiple on-body or near-body devices, some owned by a single individual, but others shared with multiple individuals. In this paper, we propose a secure system architecture for a low-power bracelet that can run multiple applications and manage access to shared resources in a body-area mHealth network. The wearer can install a personalized mix of third-party applications to support the monitoring of multiple medical conditions or wellness goals, with strong security safeguards. Our preliminary implementation and evaluation supports the hypothesis that our approach allows for the implementation of a resource monitor on far less power than would be consumed by a mobile device running Linux or Android. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that our secure architecture would enable applications to run for several weeks on a small wearable device without recharging.</div></div></div>

The data-collection system was designed to support minimally trained, non-clinical health workers to gather data about blood pressure and body weight using off-the-shelf medical sensors. This system comprises a blood-pressure cuff, a weighing scale and a portable point-of-sales printer. With this system, we introduced a new method to record contextual information associated with a blood-pressure reading using a tablet’s touchscreen and accelerometer. This contextual information can be used to verify that a patient’s lower arm remained well-supported and stationary during her blood-pressure measurement. In a preliminary user study, we found that a binary support vector machine classifier could be used to distinguish lower-arm movements from stationary arms with 90% accuracy.

Together, these two methods can allow mHealth applications to guide untrained patients (or health workers) in measuring blood pressure correctly.Usability is a particularly important design and deployment challenge in remote, rural areas, given the limited resources for technology training and support. We conducted a field study to assess our system’s usability in Kolar town, India, where we logged health worker interactions with the app’s interface using an existing usability toolkit. Researchers analyzed logs from this toolkit to evaluate the app’s user experience and quantify specific usability challenges in the app. We have recorded experiential notes from the field study in this document.</div></div></div>

In this paper we construct a prototype electromyography (EMG) sensing device that captures a single channel of EMG sensor data corresponding to user gestures. We also implement a machine learning pipeline to recognize gestural input received via our prototype sensing device. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of using a BITalino EMG sensor to recognize gestural input on a mobile health (mHealth) wearable device known as Amulet. We conduct three experiments in which we use the EMG sensor to collect gestural input data from (1) the wrist, (2) the forearm, and (3) the bicep.

On the other hand, concerned about disclosing personal information, subjects might share less than what the recipient needs and lose the opportunity to enjoy the benefits. This balance of disclosure and utility is important when the subject wants to receive some benefits, but is concerned about disclosing private information.We address this problem of balancing disclosure and utility of personal information collected by mobile technologies. We believe subjects can decide how best to share their information if they are aware of the benefits and risks of sharing. We developed ShareBuddy, a privacy-aware architecture that allows recipients to request information and specify the benefits the subjects will receive for sharing each piece of requested information; the architecture displays these benefits and warns subjects about the risks of sharing.

As these devices become ubiquitous, we also expect them to interoperate. That is, instead of closed, end-to-end body-worn sensing systems, we envision standardized sensors that wirelessly communicate their data to a device many people already carry today, the smart phone. However, this ubiquity of wireless sensors combined with the characteristics they sense present many security and privacy problems.In this thesis we describe solutions to two of these problems. First, we evaluate the use of bioimpedance for recognizing who is wearing these wireless sensors and show that bioimpedance is a feasible biometric. Second, we investigate the use of accelerometers for verifying whether two of these wireless sensors are on the same person and show that our method is successful as distinguishing between sensors on the same body and on different bodies. We stress that any solution to these problems must be usable, meaning the user should not have to do anything but attach the sensor to their body and have them <em>just work</em>just work.These methods solve interesting problems in their own right, but it is the combination of these methods that shows their true power. Combined together they allow a network of wireless sensors to cooperate and determine whom they are sensing even though only one of the wireless sensors might be able to determine this fact. If all the wireless sensors know they are on the same body as each other and one of them knows which person it is on, then they can each exploit the transitive relationship to know that they must all be on that person’s body. We show how these methods can work together in a prototype system. This ability to operate unobtrusively, collecting <em>in situ</em>in situ data and labeling it properly without interrupting the wearer’s activities of daily life, will be vital to the success of these wireless sensors.</div></div></div>

While pervasive wearable devices have long been researched, we are now beginning to see the fruits of this research in the form of commercial offerings. Today, many of these commercial wearable devices are closed systems that do not interoperate with other devices a person might carry. We believe, however, these commercial offerings signal the coming of wireless body-area networks that will connect these pervasive wearable devices and leverage existing devices a user already owns (e.g., a smartphone). Such wireless body-area networks will allow devices to specialize and utilize the capabilities of other devices in the network. A sensor, for example, might harness the internet connectivity of a smartphone to store its data in the cloud. Utilized in this way, devices will become cheaper because they will only require the components necessary for their speciality, and they will also become more pervasive because they can easily be shared between users.In order for such a vision to be successful, these devices will need to seamlessly interoperate with no interaction required of the user. As difficult as it is for users to manage their wireless area networks, it will be even more difficult for a user to manage their wireless body-area network in a truly pervasive world. As such, we believe these wearable devices should form a wireless body-area network that is passive in nature. This means that these pervasive wearable devices will require no configuration, yet they will be able form a wireless body-area network by (1) discovering their peers, (2) recognizing they are attached to the same body, (3) securing their communications, and (4) identifying to whom they are attached. While we are interested in all aspects of these passive wireless body-area networks, we focus on the last requirement: identifying who is wearing a device.</div></div></div>

These devices can record personal health information even outside the hospital setting, while the patients are at home or at their workplace. However, the devices might record sensitive information that might not be relevant for medical purposes and in some cases may be misused. Patients need expressive privacy controls so that they can trade potential health benefits of the technology with the privacy risks. To provide such privacy controls, it is important to understand what patients feel are the benefits and risks associated with the technology and what controls they want over the information.We conducted focus groups to understand the privacy concerns that patients have when they use mHealth devices. We conducted a user study to understand how willing patients are to share their personal health information that was collected using an mHealth device. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study that explores users’ privacy concerns by giving them the opportunity to actually share the information collected about them using mHealth devices. We found that patients tend to share more information with third parties than the public and prefer to keep certain information from their family and friends. Finally, based on these discoveries, we propose some guidelines to developing defaults for sharing settings in mHealth systems.</div></div></div>

To realize this vision, we propose a provenance framework for mHealth. The primary function of the framework is to collect and share provenance metadata and help the data consumer verify whether certain provenance properties are satisfied by the data they receive.</div></div></div>

If patients are not in control of the collection and sharing of their personal health information, they will have privacy concerns even while enjoying the benefits of the devices. We investigated patients’ willingness to share their personal health information, collected using mHealth devices, with their family, friends, third parties and the public. Our findings are based on a user study conducted with 41 participants. The best way to understand people’s privacy concerns is to give them the opportunity to use the device and actually share the information, and to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study that does so. We discovered that patients want to share, selectively, their health information with people other than their doctors. We also show that privacy concerns are not static; patients may change their sharing decisions over time. Based on our findings, we suggest that privacy controls for mHealth systems should be flexible to allow patients to choose different settings for different recipients, and to change their sharing settings at any time.</div></div></div>

However, blood-pressure measurements are sometimes taken with the patient’s arm in the wrong position, which can cause inaccurate readings. This paper describes a system consisting of an automatic blood pressure cuff with an accelerometer and force sensors attached to determine whether the arm is at the correct angle, held still, and properly supported.

Prescription wireless sensors worn by patients can automatically deliver medical data to care providers, dramatically improving their ability to diagnose, monitor, and manage a range of medical conditions. Using the mobile phones that patients already carry to provide connectivity between sensors and providers is essential to keeping costs low and deployments simple. Unfortunately, software-based attacks against phones are also on the rise, and successful attacks on privacy-sensitive and safety-critical applications can have significant consequences for patients.In this paper, we describe Plug-n-Trust (PnT), a novel approach to protecting both the confidentiality and integrity of safety-critical medical sensing and data processing on vulnerable mobile phones. With PnT, a plug-in smart card provides a trusted computing environment, keeping data safe even on a compromised mobile phone. By design, PnT is simple to use and deploy, while providing a flexible programming interface amenable to a wide range of applications. We describe our implementation, designed for Java-based smart cards and Android phones, in which we use a split-computation model with a novel path hashing technique to verify proper behavior without exposing confidential data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that PnT achieves its security goals while incurring acceptable overhead.</div></div></div>

That is, instead of closed, end-to-end personal health sensing systems, we envision standardized sensors wirelessly communicating their data to a device many people already carry today, the cellphone. In an open personal health sensing system, users will be able to seamlessly pair off-the-shelf sensors with their cellphone and expect the system to <em>just work</em><em>just work</em>just work. However, this ubiquity of sensors creates the potential for users to accidentally wear sensors that are not necessarily paired with their own cellphone. A husband, for example, might mistakenly wear a heart-rate sensor that is actually paired with his wife’s cellphone. As long as the heart-rate sensor is within communication range, the wife’s cellphone will be receiving heart-rate data about her husband, data that is incorrectly entered into her own health record.We provide a method to probabilistically detect this situation. Because accelerometers are relatively cheap and require little power, we imagine that the cellphone and each sensor will have a companion accelerometer embedded with the sensor itself. We extract standard features from these companion accelerometers, and use a pair-wise statistic – coherence, a measurement of how well two signals are related in the frequency domain – to determine how well features correlate for different locations on the body. We then use these feature coherences to train a classifier to recognize whether a pair of sensors – or a sensor and a cellphone – are on the same body. We evaluate our method over a dataset of several individuals walking around with sensors in various positions on their body and experimentally show that our method is capable of achieving an accuracies over 80%.</div></div></div>

One difficulty in anonymization, or more generally, sanitization, is that users lack information about the quality of a sanitization result, such as how much privacy risk a sanitized trace may expose, and how much research utility the sanitized trace may retain. We propose a framework, NetSANI, that allows users to analyze and control the privacy/utility tradeoff in network sanitization. NetSANI can accommodate most of the currently available privacy and utility metrics for network trace sanitization. This framework provides a set of APIs for analyzing the privacy/utility tradeoff by comparing the changes in privacy and utility levels of a trace for a sanitization operation. We demonstrate the framework with an quantitative evaluation on wireless-network traces.</div></div></div>

Those choosing to share trace data with colleagues must first remove or otherwise anonymize sensitive information. This process, called sanitization, represents a tradeoff between the removal of information in the interest of identity protection and the preservation of data within the trace that is most relevant to researchers. While several metrics exist to quantify this privacy-utility tradeoff, they are often computationally expensive. Computing these metrics using a sample of the trace, rather than the entire input trace, could potentially save precious time and space resources, provided the accuracy of these values does not suffer. In this paper, we examine several simple sampling methods to discover their effects on measurement of the privacy-utility tradeoff when anonymizing network traces prior to their sharing or publication. After sanitizing a small sample trace collected from the Dartmouth College wireless network, we tested the relative accuracy of a variety of previously implemented packet and flow-sampling methods on a few existing privacy and utility metrics. This analysis led us to conclude that, for our test trace, no single sampling method we examined allowed us to accurately measure the trade-off, and that some sampling methods can produce grossly inaccurate estimates of those values.

One key challenge in these systems is how to extract interesting or unusual information. Because users cannot anticipate their future interests in the data when the data is stored, it is hard to provide appropriate indexes. As location-tracking technologies, such as global positioning system, have become ubiquitous, digital cameras or other pervasive systems record location information along with the data. In this paper, we present an automatic approach to identify unusual data using location information. Given the location information, our system identifies unusual days, that is, days with unusual mobility patterns. We evaluated our detection system using a real wireless trace, collected at wireless access points, and demonstrated its capabilities. Using our system, we were able to identify days when mobility patterns changed and differentiate days when a user followed a regular pattern from the rest. We also discovered general mobility characteristics. For example, most users had one or more repeating mobility patterns, and repeating mobility patterns did not depend on certain days of the week, except that weekends were different from weekdays.</div></div></div>

Thus, they have high values of the Bridging Centrality (BC) metric. We recently introduced the Localized Bridging Centrality (LBC) metric, which can identify such nodes via distributed computation, yet has an accuracy equal to that of the centralized BC metric. The LBC and BC metrics are based on the Social Network Analysis (SNA) metric “betweenness centrality”. We now introduce a new SNA metric that is more suitable for use in wireless mesh networks: the Localized Load-aware Bridging Centrality (LLBC) metric. The LLBC metric improves upon LBC by detecting critical bridging nodes while taking into account the actual traffic flows present in a mesh network. We only use local information from surrounding nodes to compute the LLBC metric, thus our LLBC metric is designed for scalable distributed computation and distributed network analysis. We developed the SNA Plugin (SNAP) for the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol to study the potential use of LBC and LLBC in improving multicast communications. We present some promising initial results for SNAP from real and emulated mesh networks. SNAP is open source and free for academic use.</div></div></div>

Understanding the wireless edge is therefore important for understanding the performance and security aspects of the Internet experience. This need is especially necessary for enterprise-wide wireless local-area networks (WLANs) as organizations increasingly depend on WLANs for mission-critical tasks. To study a live production WLAN, especially a large-scale network, is a difficult undertaking. Two fundamental difficulties involved are (1) building a scalable network measurement infrastructure to collect traces from a large-scale production WLAN, and (2) preserving user privacy while sharing these collected traces to the network research community. In this dissertation, we present our experience in designing and implementing one of the largest distributed WLAN measurement systems in the United States, the Dartmouth Internet Security Testbed (DIST), with a particular focus on our solutions to the challenges of efficiency, scalability, and security. We also present an extensive evaluation of the DIST system. To understand the severity of some potential trace-sharing risks for an enterprise-wide large-scale wireless network, we conduct privacy analysis on one kind of wireless network traces, a user-association log, collected from a large-scale WLAN. We introduce a machine-learning based approach that can extract and quantify sensitive information from a user-association log, even though it is sanitized. Finally, we present a case study that evaluates the tradeoff between utility and privacy on WLAN trace sanitization.</div></div></div>

By their very nature, these traces capture sensitive business and personal activity. Furthermore, network traces contain significant operational information about the target network, such as its structure, identity of the network provider, or addresses of important servers. To protect private or proprietary information, researchers must “sanitize”sanitize a trace before sharing it.In this chapter, we survey the growing body of research that addresses the risks, methods, and evaluation of network trace sanitization. Research on the risks of network trace sanitization attempts to extract information from published network traces, while research on sanitization methods investigates approaches that may protect against such attacks. Although researchers have recently proposed both quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the effectiveness of sanitization methods, such work has several shortcomings, some of which we highlight in a discussion of open problems. Sanitizing a network trace, however challenging, remains an important method for advancing network–based research.</div></div></div>

It must be possible for patients to grant or deny access to the data on the storage unit (mobile phones or personal health records (PHR)).

The self-regulation model, while seemingly valuable, needs practical tools to help patients adopt this self-centered approach for long-term care.In this position paper, we propose Mobile-phone based Patient Compliance System (MPCS) that can reduce the time-consuming and error-prone processes of existing self-regulation practice to facilitate self-reporting, non-compliance detection, and compliance reminders. The novelty of this work is to apply social-behavior theories to engineer the MPCS to positively influence patients’ compliance behaviors, including mobile-delivered contextual reminders based on association theory; mobile-triggered questionnaires based on self-perception theory; and mobile-enabled social interactions based on social-construction theory.

This highly dynamic and mobile setting, where humans are the central focus, presents new challenges for information security, because data originates from sensors carried by people— not tiny sensors thrown in the forest or attached to animals.

For bandwidth efficiency, we propose a collaborative data-reduction mechanism, “group-aware stream filtering”, used together with multicast, to select a small set of necessary data that satisfy the needs of a group of subscribers simultaneously. We turn data-compressing filters into group-aware filters by exploiting two overlooked, yet important, properties of monitoring applications: 1) many of them can tolerate some degree of “slack” in their data quality requirements, and 2) there may exist multiple subsets of the source data satisfying the quality needs of an application. We can thus choose the “best alternative” subset for each application to maximize the data overlap within the group to best benefit from multicasting. We provide a general framework that treats the group-aware stream filtering problem completely; we prove the problem NP-hard and thus provide a suite of heuristic algorithms that ensure data quality (specifically, granularity and timeliness) while collaboratively reducing data. The framework is extensible and supports a diverse range of filters. Our prototype-based evaluation shows that group-aware stream filtering is effective in trading CPU time for data reduction, compared with self-interested filtering.</div></div></div>

Since each organization protects its resources with its local authorization policies, we need mechanisms for cross-domain authorization to achieve information sharing among multiple organizations. Unfortunately, traditional identity-based authorization approaches are impractical, because the identity of a requester is not a useful clue for authorization in a decentralized environment. Many distributed authorization schemes, therefore, consider a requester’s properties (e.g., employer and physical location) to make an authorization decision and use a logic-based approach to specify authorization policies in a flexible way. Such a distributed proof system makes an authorization decision by constructing a proof with information provided by different entities in a distributed environment. In this chapter, we provide an overview of distributed proof systems for cross-domain authorization, while covering major language constructs and proof-constructing algorithms, and introduce an emerging issue of protecting confidential policies and credentials (facts) in a distributed proof system involving multiple security domains since it is unlikely that a principal in one security domain is willing to release all its local information to any principal in other domains. We finally describe our distributed proof system for cross-domain authorization in detail and show how our cryptographic protocol allows mutually untrusted principals to construct a proof in a decentralized way while preserving each principal’s security policies.</div></div></div>

In order to exploit this phenomena, we propose a novel approach to adapt a network to changing conditions; we introduce “a combined routing method” that allows the network to seamlessly swap from one routing protocol to another protocol dynamically, while routing continues uninterrupted. By creating a thin new virtual layer, we enable each node in the ad hoc wireless network notify each other about the protocol swap and we do not make any changes to existing routing protocols. To ensure that routing works efficiently after the protocol swap, we reuse information from the previous protocol’s routing table while initializing the data structures for the new routing protocol. We study the feasibility of our technique and the overheads incurred while swapping between AODV, ODMRP and APRL under different network topologies and traffic patterns through detailed simulations. Our results show that the swap latency is related to the nature of the destination protocol and the topology of the network. We also find that the control packet ratio of a routing protocol during and after a swap is close to that of the protocol running before a swap, thus indicating that our approach does not add excessive overhead.</div></div></div>

A sensing application distributes sensing “tasks,”tasks, which specify what sensor data to collect and under what conditions to report the data back to the application. To perform a task, mobile nodes may use on-board sensors, a body-area network of personal sensors, or sensors from neighboring nodes that volunteer to contribute their sensing resources. In all three cases, continuous sensor monitoring can drain a node’s battery.We propose DEAMON (Distributed Energy-Aware MONitoring), an energy-efficient distributed algorithm for long-term sensor monitoring. Our approach assumes only that mobile nodes are tasked to report sensor data under conditions specified by a Boolean expression, and that a network of nearby sensor nodes contribute to monitoring subsets of the task’s sensors. Our algorithm to select sensor nodes and to monitor the sensing condition conserves energy of all nodes by limiting sensing and communication operations. We evaluate DEAMON with a stochastic analysis and with simulation results, and show that it should significantly reduce energy consumption.</div></div></div>

Patient authentication is a necessary security requirement in remote health monitoring scenarios. The monitoring system needs to make sure that the data is coming from the right person before any medical or financial decisions are made based on the data. Credential-based authentication methods (e.g., passwords, certificates) are not well-suited for remote healthcare as patients could hand over credentials to someone else. Furthermore, one-time authentication using credentials or trait-based biometrics (e.g., face, fingerprints, iris) do not cover the entire monitoring period and may lead to unauthorized post-authentication use. Recent studies have shown that the human electrocardiogram (ECG) exhibits unique patterns that can be used to discriminate individuals. However, perturbation of the ECG signal due to physical activity is a major obstacle in applying the technology in real-world situations. In this paper, we present a novel ECG and accelerometer-based system that can authenticate individuals in an ongoing manner under various activity conditions. We describe the probabilistic authentication system we have developed and present experimental results from 17 individuals.</div></div></div>

Health-monitoring systems built on such sensors have huge potential benefit to the quality of healthcare and quality of life for many people, such as patients with chronic medical conditions (such as blood-sugar sensors for diabetics), people seeking to change unhealthy behavior (such as losing weight or quitting smoking), or athletes wishing to monitor their condition and performance. To be effective, however, these systems must provide assurances about the quality of the sensor data. The sensors must be applied to the patient by a human, and the sensor data may be transported across multiple networks and devices before it is presented to the medical team. While no system can guarantee data quality, we anticipate that it will help for the system to annotate data with some measure of <em>confidence</em>. In this paper, we take a deeper look at potential health-monitoring usage scenarios and highlight research challenges required to ensure and assess quality of sensor data in health-monitoring systems.</div></div></div>

The core of Solar is a scalable and self-organizing peer-to-peer overlay to support data-driven services. We describe how different services can be systematically integrated on top of the Solar overlay and evaluate the resource discovery and data-dissemination services.

Although our AnonySense system (presented at MobiSys) addresses privacy in people-centric sensing, protecting data integrity in people-centric sensing still remains a challenge.

Enterprises large and small, homeowners, and even whole cities have deployed Wi-Fi networks for their users, and many users never need to— or never bother to— use the wired network. With the advent of high-throughput wireless networks (such as 802.11n) some new construction, even of large enterprise build- ings, may no longer be wired for Ethernet. To understand Internet traffic, then, we need to understand the wireless edge. Measuring Wi-Fi traffic, however, is challenging. It is insufficient to capture traffic in the access points, or upstream of the access points, because the activity of neighboring networks, ad hoc networks, and physical interference cannot be seen at that level. To truly understand the MAC-layer behavior, we need to capture frames from the air using Air Monitors (AMs) placed in the vicinity of the network. Such a capture is always a sample of the network activity, since it is physically impossible to capture a full trace: all frames from all channels at all times in all places. We have built a monitoring infrastructure that captures frames from the 802.11 network. This infrastructure includes several “channel sampling” strategies that will capture repre- sentative traffic from the network. Further, the monitoring infrastructure needs to modify its behavior according to feedback received from the downstream consumers of the captured traffic in case the analysis needs traffic of a certain type. We call this technique “refocusing”. The “coordinated sampling” technique improves the efficiency of the monitoring by utilizing the AMs intelligently. Finally, we deployed this measurement infrastructure within our Computer Science building to study the performance of the system with real network traffic.</div></div></div>

To understand the Internet, one must understand the edge, and yet the measurement of wireless networks poses many new challenges. IEEE 802.11 networks support multiple wireless channels and any monitoring technique involves capturing traffic on each of these channels to gather a representative sample of frames from the network. We call this procedure <em>channel sampling</em>channel sampling, in which each sniffer visits each channel periodically, resulting in a sample of the traffic on each of the channels.This sampling approach may be sufficient, for example, for a system administrator or anomaly detection module to observe some unusual behavior in the network. Once an anomaly is detected, however, the administrator may require a more extensive traffic sample, or need to identify the location of an offending device.We propose a method to allow measurement applications to dynamically modify the sampling strategy, <em>refocusing</em>refocusing the monitoring system to pay more attention to certain types of traffic than others.

As “Wi-Fi”Wi-Fi technology becomes ubiquitous, it is increasingly important to understand trends in the usage of these networks. This paper analyzes an extensive network trace from a mature 802.11 WLAN, including more than 550 access points and 7000 users over seventeen weeks. We employ several measurement techniques, including syslog messages, telephone records, SNMP polling and tcpdump packet captures. This is the largest WLAN study to date, and the first to look at a mature WLAN. We compare this trace to a trace taken after the network’s initial deployment two years prior.We found that the applications used on the WLAN changed dramatically, with significant increases in peer-to-peer and streaming multimedia traffic. Despite the introduction of a Voice over IP (VoIP) system that includes wireless handsets, our study indicates that VoIP has been used little on the wireless network thus far, and most VoIP calls are made on the wired network.We saw greater heterogeneity in the types of clients used, with more embedded wireless devices such as PDAs and mobile VoIP clients. We define a new metric for mobility, the “session diameter”session diameter. We use this metric to show that embedded devices have different mobility characteristics than laptops, and travel further and roam to more access points. Overall, users were surprisingly non-mobile, with half remaining close to home about 98% of the time.</div></div></div>

Those data sources, such as web click-streams, stock quotes, and sensor data, are often characterized as fast-rate high-volume “streams”. Distributed stream-processing systems are thus designed to efficiently use system resources to serve the data-acquisition needs of the applications. Most of the state-of-the-art stream-processing systems assume an Ethernet-based network whose bandwidth is abundant, and focus on mechanisms to save computational power and memory. For applications involving wireless networks, particularly multi-hop mesh networks, we recognize that the most limiting factor in efficiently processing streams lies in the network’s highly constrained bandwidth. Hence, this dissertation proposes a group-aware stream filtering approach that saves bandwidth at the cost of increased CPU time, for low-bandwidth data-streaming systems. This approach, used together with multicasting, exploits two overlooked properties of monitoring applications: 1) many of them can tolerate some degree of “slack” in their data quality requirements, and 2) there may exist multiple subsets of the source data satisfying the quality needs of an application. We can thus choose the “best alternative” subset for each application to maximize the data overlap within the group to best benefit from multicasting. After proving the problem NP-hard, we introduce a suite of heuristics-based algorithms that ensure data quality, specifically data granularity and timeliness, in addition to preserving network bandwidth. Our framework for group-aware stream filtering is extensible and supports a diverse range of filtering needs of monitoring applications. We evaluate this approach with a prototype system based on real-world data sets. The results show that quality-managed group-aware filtering is effective in trading CPU time for bandwidth savings, compared with self-interested stream filtering. We also evaluate the effect of each algorithm on temporal freshness of the data. Finally, we discuss other application realms that might benefit from group-aware stream filtering.</div></div></div>

For bandwidth efficiency, we propose a <em>group-aware stream filtering</em> approach, used together with multicasting, that exploits two overlooked, yet important, properties of monitoring applications: 1) many of them can tolerate some degree of “slack” in their data quality requirements, and 2) there may exist multiple subsets of the source data satisfying the quality needs of an application. We can thus choose the “best alternative” subset for each application to maximize the data overlap within the group to best benefit from multicasting. Here we provide a general framework for the group-aware stream filtering problem, which we prove is NP-hard. We introduce a suite of heuristics-based algorithms that ensure data quality (specifically, granularity and timeliness) while preserving bandwidth. Our evaluation shows that group-aware stream filtering is effective in trading CPU time for bandwidth savings, compared with self-interested filtering.</div></div></div>

Mobile mesh networks can be deployed rapidly to provide an alternate communication infrastructure for emergency response operations in areas with limited or damaged infrastructure.In this dissertation, we present Dart-Mesh: a Linux-based layer-3 dual-radio two-tiered mesh network that provides complete 802.11b coverage in the Sudikoff Lab for Computer Science at Dartmouth College. We faced several challenges in building, testing, monitoring and managing this network. These challenges motivated us to design and implement Mesh-Mon, a network monitoring system to aid system administrators in the management of a mobile mesh network. Mesh-Mon is a scalable, distributed and decentralized management system in which mesh nodes cooperate in a proactive manner to help detect, diagnose and resolve network problems automatically. Mesh-Mon is independent of the routing protocol used by the mesh routing layer and can function even if the routing protocol fails. We demonstrate this feature by running Mesh-Mon on two versions of Dart-Mesh, one running on AODV (a reactive mesh routing protocol) and the second running on OLSR (a proactive mesh routing protocol) in separate experiments.Mobility can cause links to break, leading to disconnected partitions. We identify critical nodes in the network, whose failure may cause a partition. We introduce two new metrics based on social-network analysis: the Localized Bridging Centrality (LBC) metric and the Localized Load-aware Bridging Centrality (LLBC) metric, that can identify critical nodes efficiently and in a fully distributed manner.We run a monitoring component on client nodes, called Mesh-Mon-Ami, which also assists Mesh-Mon nodes in the dissemination of management information between physically disconnected partitions, by acting as carriers for management data.We conclude, from our experimental evaluation on our 16-node Dart-Mesh testbed, that our system solves several management challenges in a scalable manner, and is a useful and effective tool for monitoring and managing real-world mesh networks.</div></div></div>

They can be rapidly deployed by first responders in the wake of a major disaster to augment an existing wireless or wired network. We imagine a mesh node with multiple radios embedded in each emergency vehicle arriving at the site to form the backbone of a mobile wireless mesh. The ability of such a mesh network to monitor itself, diagnose faults and anticipate problems are essential features for its sustainable operation. Typical SNMP-based centralized solutions introduce a single point of failure and are unsuitable for managing such a network. <em>Mesh-Mon</em> is a decentralized monitoring and management system designed for such a mobile, rapidly-deployed, unplanned mesh network and works independently of the underlying mesh routing protocol. Mesh-Mon nodes are designed to actively cooperate and use localized algorithms to predict, detect, diagnose and resolve network problems in a scalable manner. Mesh-Mon is independent of the underlying routing protocol and can operate even if the mesh routing protocol completely fails. A novel aspect of our approach is that we employ mobile users of the mesh, running software called <em>Mesh-Mon-Ami</em> to ferry management packets between physically-disconnected partitions in a delay-tolerant network manner. The main contributions of this paper are the design, implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive monitoring and management architecture that helps a network administrator proactively identify, diagnose and resolve a range of issues that can occur in a dynamic mesh network. In experiments on <em>Dart-Mesh</em>, our 16-node indoor mesh testbed, we found Mesh-Mon to be effective in quickly diagnosing and resolving a variety of problems with high accuracy, without adding significant management overhead.</div></div></div>

An adversary can exploit this vulnerability to launch a large number of attacks. For example, an attacker may masquerade as a legitimate access point to disrupt network services or to advertise false services, tricking nearby wireless stations. On the other hand, the received signal strength (RSS) is a measurement that is hard to forge arbitrarily and it is highly correlated to the transmitter’s location. Assuming the attacker and the victim are separated by a reasonable distance, RSS can be used to differentiate them to detect MAC spoofing, as recently proposed by several researchers.By analyzing the RSS pattern of typical 802.11 transmitters in a 3-floor building covered by 20 air monitors, we observed that the RSS readings followed a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. We discovered that this phenomenon was mainly due to <em>antenna diversity</em><em>antenna diversity</em>antenna diversity, a widely-adopted technique to improve the stability and robustness of wireless connectivity. This observation renders existing approaches ineffective because they assume a single RSS source. We propose an approach based on Gaussian mixture models, building RSS profiles for spoofing detection. Experiments on the same testbed show that our method is robust against antenna diversity and significantly outperforms existing approaches. At a 3% false positive rate, we detect 73.4%, 89.6% and 97.8% of attacks using the three proposed algorithms, based on local statistics of a single AM, combining local results from AMs, and global multi-AM detection, respectively.</div></div></div>

Handoff prediction in wireless networks has long been considered as a mechanism to improve the quality of service provided to mobile wireless users. Most prior studies, however, were based on theoretical analysis, simulation with synthetic mobility models, or small wireless network traces. We study the effect of mobility prediction for a large realistic wireless situation. We tackle the problem by using traces collected from a large production wireless network to evaluate several major families of handoff-location prediction techniques, a set of handoff-time predictors, and a predictor that jointly predicts handoff location and time. We also propose a fallback mechanism, which uses a lower-order predictor whenever a higher-order predictor fails to predict. We found that low-order Markov predictors, with our proposed fallback mechanisms, performed as well or better than the more complex and more space-consuming compression-based handoff-location predictors. Although our handoff-time predictor had modest prediction accuracy, in the context of mobile voice applications we found that bandwidth reservation strategies can benefit from the combined location and time handoff predictor, significantly reducing the call-drop rate without significantly increasing the call-block rate. We also developed a prediction-based routing protocol for mobile opportunistic networks. We evaluated and compared our protocol’s performance to five existing routing protocols, using simulations driven by real mobility traces. We found that the basic routing protocols are not practical for large-scale opportunistic networks. Prediction-based routing protocols trade off the message delivery ratio against resource usage and performed well and comparable to each other.</div></div></div>

User preferences about location privacy may depend on place, not only in terms of their physical location but also in terms of their social context: how they define where they are, what they are doing, and whom they are with at the time. Using the experience sampling method, the authors explored the privacy preferences of 25 users during one week. They found that participants were more willing to share location information when at home or alone than when at other locations or with friends. Most participants were consistent in their location privacy preferences across requester categories and regardless of place. Some participants, however, varied in their willingness to share location information depending on where they were, who they were with, and who was requesting the information. Those participants tended to be more concerned about privacy in general. These findings are useful for designing future privacy policies and user interfaces for pervasive computing.

Monitoring the health of these networks, whether it is for failure, coverage or attacks, is important in terms of security, connectivity, cost, and performance.Effective monitoring of wireless network traffic, using commodity hardware, is a challenging task due to the limitations of the hardware. IEEE 802.11 networks support multiple channels, and a wireless interface can monitor only a single channel at one time. Thus, capturing all frames passing an interface on all channels is an impossible task, and we need strategies to capture the most representative sample.When a large geographic area is to be monitored, several monitoring stations must be deployed, and these will typically overlap in their area of coverage. The competing goals of effective wireless monitoring are to capture as many frames as possible, while minimizing the number of those frames that are captured redundantly by more than one monitoring station. Both goals may be addressed with a sampling strategy that directs neighboring monitoring stations to different channels during any period. To be effective, such a strategy requires timely access to the nature of all recent traffic.We propose a coordinated sampling strategy that meets these goals. Our implemented solution involves a central controller considering traffic characteristics from many monitoring stations to periodically develop specific sampling policies for each station. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our coordinated sampling strategy by comparing it with existing independent strategies. Our coordinated strategy enabled more distinct frames to be captured, providing a solid foundation for focused sampling and intrusion detection.</div></div></div>

Most prior work on sensor networks has focused on collecting and processing ephemeral data about the environment using a static topology and an application-aware infrastructure. People-centric urban sensing, however, involves collecting, storing, processing and fusing large volumes of data related to every-day human activities. Sensing is performed in a highly dynamic and mobile environment, and supports (among other things) pervasive computing applications that are focused on enhancing the user’s experience. In such a setting, where humans are the central focus, there are new challenges for information security; not only because of the complex and dynamic communication patterns, but also because the data originates from sensors that are carried by a person—not a tiny sensor thrown in the forest or mounted on the neck of an animal. In this paper we aim to instigate discussion about this critical issue—because people-centric sensing will never succeed without adequate provisions for security and privacy. To that end, we outline several important challenges and suggest general solutions that hold promise in this new paradigm of sensor networks.</div></div></div>

The numerous and diverse sensors in these environments can record contextual information about users, leading to users unwittingly leaving “digital footprints.” Users must therefore be allowed to control how their digital footprints are reported to third parties. While a significant amount of prior work has focused on location privacy, location is only one specific type of footprint, and we expect most users to be incapable of specifying fine-grained policies for a multitude of footprints. In this paper we present a policy language based on the metaphor of physical walls, and posit that users will find this to be an intuitive way to control access to their digital footprints. For example, users understand the physical privacy implications of conducting a meeting in a room enclosed by physical walls. By allowing users to deploy “virtual walls,” they can control the privacy of their digital footprints much in the same way they control their privacy in the physical world. We present a policy framework and model for virtual walls with three levels of transparency that correspond to intuitive levels of privacy. We also describe the results of a user study (N = 23) that indicates that our model is easy to understand and use.</div></div></div>

We used the Fourier transform to reveal important periods and chose the two strongest periods to serve as parameters to a classification system based on Bayes’ theory. Analysis of 1-month traces shows that while a daily pattern is common among both users and APs, a weekly pattern is common only for APs. Analysis of 1-year traces revealed that both user mobility and AP popularity depend on the academic calendar.

By the insertion of a thin new layer, we were able to make each node in the ad hoc wireless network notify each other about the protocol swap. To ensure that routing works efficiently after the protocol swap, we initialized the destination routing protocol’s data structures and reused the previous routing information to build the new routing table. We also tested our approach under different network topologies and traffic patterns in static networks to learn whether the swap was fast and whether the swap incurred too much overhead. We found that the swap latency was related to the nature of the destination protocol and the topology of the network. We also found that the control packet ratio after swap was close to that of the protocol running without swap, which indicates that our method does not incur too much overhead for the swap.</div></div></div>

A growing body of research, however, indicates that the behavior of the protocol stack may depend significantly on these underlying assumptions. The standard response to this problem is a call for more realism in designing radio models. But how much realism is enough? This study is the first to approach this question by validating simulator performance (both at the physical and application layers) with the results of real-world data. Referencing an extensive set of measurements from a large outdoor routing experiment, we start by evaluating the relative realism of common assumptions made in radio model design, identifying those which provide a reasonable approximation of reality. Although several such investigations have been made for static sensor networks, radio behavior in mobile network deployments is a much less-studied topic. We then reproduce our experimental setup in our simulator, and generate the same application-layer metrics under progressively smaller sets of these assumptions.

Many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to address the problem, but few were evaluated in a realistic “opportunistic” network setting. We use simulation and contact traces (derived from logs in a production network) to evaluate and compare five existing protocols: direct-delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, and Link-State, as well as our own proposed routing protocol. We show that the direct delivery and epidemic routing protocols suffer either low delivery ratio or high resource usage, and other protocols make tradeoffs between delivery ratio and resource usage.</div></div></div>

Moreover, some applications may require the deployment of multiple sniffers to monitor the numerous channels in an 802.11 network. In this paper, we explore sampling strategies for monitoring multiple channels in 802.11b/g networks. We describe a simple sampling strategy, where each channel is observed for an equal, predetermined length of time, and consider applications where such a strategy might be appropriate. We then introduce a sampling strategy that weights the time spent on each channel according to the number of frames observed on that channel, and compare the two strategies under experimental conditions.</div></div></div>

Because most current location-sensing techniques work only either indoors or outdoors, researchers have started using 802.11 beacon frames from access points (APs) to provide broader coverage. To use 802.11 beacons, they need to know AP locations. Because the actual locations are often unavailable, they use estimated locations from <em>war driving</em>. But these estimated locations may be different from actual locations. In this paper, we analyzed the errors in these estimates and the effect of these errors on other applications that depend on them. We found that the estimated AP locations have a median error of 32 meters. We considered the error in tracking user positions both indoors and outdoors. Using actual AP locations, we could improve the accuracy as much as 70% for indoors and 59% for outdoors. We also analyzed the effect of using estimated AP locations in computing AP coverage range and estimating interference among APs. The coverage range appeared to be shorter and the interference appeared to be more severe than in reality.</div></div></div>

We present a method to estimate the physical location of users from a large trace of mobile devices associating with access points in a wireless network. Using this method, we extracted tracks of always-on Wi-Fi devices from a 13-month trace. We discovered that the speed and pause time each follow a log-normal distribution and that the direction of movements closely reflects the direction of roads and walkways.

We show that our approach provides high reliability, often considered critical for disseminating codes. In addition FBcast offers limited data confidentiality. For a large network, where every node may not be reachable by the source, we extend FBcast with the idea of repeaters to improve reliable coverage.

Such a context-sensitive authorization scheme is necessary when a mobile user moves across multiple administrative domains where they are not registered in advance. Also, users interacting with their environment need a non-intrusive way to access resources, and clues about their context may be useful input into authorization policies for these resources. Existing systems for context-sensitive authorization take a logic-based approach, because a logical language makes it possible to define a context model where a contextual fact is expressed with a boolean predicate and to derive higher-level context information and authorization decisions from contextual facts.However, those existing context-sensitive authorization systems have a central server that collects context information, and evaluates policies to make authorization decisions on behalf of a resource owner. A centralized solution assumes that all resource owners trust the server to make correct decisions, and all users trust the server not to disclose private context information. In many realistic applications of pervasive computing, however, the resources, users, and sources of context information are inherently distributed among many organizations that do not necessarily trust each other. Resource owners may not trust the integrity of context information produced by another domain, and context sensors may not trust others with the confidentiality of data they provide about users.In this thesis, we present a secure distributed proof system for context-sensitive authorization. Our system enables multiple hosts to evaluate an authorization query in a peer-to-peer way, while preserving the confidentiality and integrity policies of mutually untrusted principals running those hosts. We also develop a novel caching and revocation mechanism to support context-sensitive policies that refer to information in dozens of different administrative domains. Contributions of this thesis include the definition of fine-grained security policies that specify trust relations among principals in terms of information confidentiality and integrity, the design and implementation of a secure distributed proof system, a proof for the correctness of our algorithm, and a performance evaluation showing that the amortized performance of our system scales to dozens of servers in different domains.</div></div></div>

Those systems might define rules that refer to the users’ context information to provide context-aware services. For example, a smart-home application could define rules referring to the location of a user to control the light of a house automatically. In general, the context information is maintained in different administrative domains, and it is, therefore, desirable to construct a proof in a distributed way while preserving each domain’s confidentiality policies. In this paper, we introduce such a system, a secure distributed proof system for context-sensitive authorization and show that our novel caching and revocation mechanism improves the performance of the system, which depends on public key cryptographic operations to protect confidential information in rules and facts. Our revocation mechanism maintains dependencies among facts and recursively revokes across multiple hosts all the cached facts that depend on a fact that has become invalid. Our initial experimental results show that our caching mechanism, which maintains both positive and negative facts, significantly reduces the latency for handling a logical query.</div></div></div>

A key challenge in this environment is to provide efficient access to data distributed across remote data servers. Our parallel I/O framework, called Armada, allows application and data-set providers to flexibly compose graphs of processing modules that describe the distribution, application interfaces, and processing required of the dataset before computation. Although the framework provides a simple programming model for the application programmer and the data-set provider, the resulting graph may contain bottlenecks that prevent efficient data access. In this paper, we present an algorithm used to restructure Armada graphs that distributes computation and data flow to improve performance in the context of a wide-area computational grid.</div></div></div>

In the long term, the success of WLANs depends on services that support mobile network clients.Although other researchers have explored mobility prediction in hypothetical scenarios, evaluating their predictors analytically or with synthetic data, few studies have been able to evaluate their predictors with real user mobility data. As a first step towards filling this fundamental gap, we work with a large data set collected from the Dartmouth College campus-wide wireless network that hosts more than 500 access points and 6,000 users. Extending our earlier work that focuses on predicting the next-visited access point (i.e., location), in this work we explore the predictability of the time of user mobility. Indeed, our contributions are two-fold. First, we evaluate a series of predictors that reflect possible dependencies across time and space while benefiting from either individual or group mobility behaviors. Second, as a case study we examine voice applications and the use of handoff prediction for advance bandwidth reservation. Using application-specific performance metrics such as call drop and call block rates, we provide a picture of the potential gains of prediction.Our results indicate that it is difficult to predict handoff time accurately, when applied to real campus WLAN data. However, the findings of our case study also suggest that application performance can be improved significantly even with predictors that are only moderately accurate. The gains depend on the applications’ ability to use predictions and tolerate inaccurate predictions. In the case study, we combine the real mobility data with synthesized traffic data. The results show that intelligent prediction can lead to significant reductions in the rate at which active calls are dropped due to handoffs with marginal increments in the rate at which new calls are blocked.</div></div></div>

When the data sender is sensing the physical environment, however, a pause is equivalent to dropping data. Instead of arbitrarily dropping data that may contain important events, we present a policy-driven data dissemination service named PACK, based on an overlay-based infrastructure for efficient multicast delivery. PACK enforces application-specified policies that define how to discard or summarize data flows wherever queues overflow on the data path, notably at the mobile hosts where applications often reside. A key contribution of our approach is to uniformly apply the data-stream “packing” abstraction to queue overflow caused by network congestion, slow receivers, and temporary disconnection.

By the insertion of a new layer, we were able to make each node in the ad hoc wireless network notify each other about the protocol swap. To ensure that routing works efficiently after the protocol swap, we initialized the destination routing protocol’s data structures and reused the previous routing information to build the new routing table. We also tested our approach under different network topologies and traffic patterns in static networks to learn whether the swap is fast and whether the swap incurs too much overload . We found that the swap latency is related to the destination protocol and the topology of the network. We also found that the control packet ratio after swap is close to the protocol running without swap, which means our method does not incur too many control packets for swap.</div></div></div>

To classify mobile users, we computed diameter (the maximum distance between any two APs visited by a user during a fixed time period) and observed how this quantity changes or repeats over time. We found that user mobility had a strong period of one day, but there was also a large group of users that had either a much smaller or much bigger primary period. Both primary and secondary periods had important roles in determining classes of mobile users. Users with one day as their primary period and a smaller secondary period were most prevalent; we expect that they were mostly students taking regular classes. To classify APs, we counted the number of users visited each AP. The primary period did not play a critical role because it was equal to one day for most of the APs; the secondary period was the determining parameter. APs with one day as their primary period and one week as their secondary period were most prevalent. By plotting the classes of APs on our campus map, we discovered that this periodic behavior of APs seemed to be independent of their geographical locations, but may depend on the relative locations of nearby APs.

Using real mobility traces, we can build a mobility model that reflects reality. In building a mobility model, it is important to note that while the number of handheld wireless devices is constantly increasing, laptops are still the majority in most cases. As a laptop is often disconnected from the network while a user is moving, it is not feasible to extract the exact path of the user from network messages. Thus, instead of modeling individual user’s movements, we model movements in terms of the influx and outflux of users between access points (APs). We first counted the hourly visits to APs in the syslog messages recorded at APs. We found that the hourly number of visits has a periodic repetition of 24 hours. Based on this observation, we aggregated the visits of multiple days into a single day. We then clustered APs based on the different peak hour of visits. We found that this approach of clustering is effective; we ended up with four distinct clusters and a cluster of stable APs. We then computed the average arrival rate and the distribution of the daily arrivals for each cluster. Using a standard method (such as <em>thinning</em>) for generating non-homogeneous Poisson processes, synthetic traces can be generated from our model.</div></div></div>

This paper presents results from the largest and most comprehensive trace of network activity in a large, production wireless LAN. For eleven weeks we traced the activity of nearly two thousand users drawn from a general campus population, using a campus-wide network of 476 access points spread over 161 buildings at Dartmouth College. Our study expands on those done by Tang and Baker, with a significantly larger and broader population.We found that residential traffic dominated all other traffic, particularly in residences populated by newer students; students are increasingly choosing a wireless laptop as their primary computer. Although web protocols were the single largest component of traffic volume, network backup and file sharing contributed an unexpectedly large amount to the traffic. Although there was some roaming within a network session, we were surprised by the number of situations in which cards roamed excessively, unable to settle on one access point. Cross-subnet roams were an especial problem, because they broke IP connections, indicating the need for solutions that avoid or accommodate such roams.</div></div></div>

One should not, however, underestimate the importance of validation— the process of ensuring whether a simulation model is an appropriate representation of the real-world system. Validation of wireless network simulations is difficult due to strong interdependencies among protocols at different layers and uncertainty in the wireless environment. The authors present an approach of coupling direct-execution simulation and traces from real outdoor experiments to validating simple wireless models that are used commonly in simulations of wireless ad hoc networks. This article documents a common testbed that supports direct execution of a set of ad hoc routing protocol implementations in a wireless network simulator. By comparing routing behavior measured in the real experiment with behavior computed by the simulation, the authors validate the models of radio behavior upon which protocol behavior depends.</div></div></div>

In this dissertation, we present a Context Fusion Network (CFN), called Solar, which is built with a scalable and self-organized service overlay. Solar is flexible and allows applications to select distributed data sources and compose them with customized data-fusion operators into a directed acyclic information flow graph. Such a graph represents how an application computes high-level understandings of its execution context from low-level sensory data. To manage application-specified operators on a set of overlay nodes called Planets, Solar provides several unique services such as application-level multicast with policy-driven data reduction to handle buffer overflow, context-sensitive resource discovery to handle environment dynamics, and proactive monitoring and recovery to handle common failures. Experimental results show that these services perform well on a typical DHT-based peer-to-peer routing substrate. In this dissertation, we also discuss experience, insights, and lessons learned from our quantitative analysis of the input sensors, a detailed case study of a Solar application, and development of other applications in different domains.</div></div></div>

Our goal is to study characteristics of these location systems ant how these factors should be taken into account by a potentially large number of location-aware applications with different needs. We make empirical measurements of several important metrics and compare the results across these location systems.

These applications need to monitor data streams produced by sensors and react to changes. When mobile sensors and applications are connected by low-bandwidth wireless networks, sensor data rates may overwhelm the capacity of network links or of the applications. In traditional networks and distributed systems, flow-control and congestion-control policies either drop data or force the sender to pause. When the data sender is sensing the physical environment, however, a pause is equivalent to dropping data. Arbitrary data drops are not necessarily acceptable to the reactive mobile applications receiving sensor data. Data distribution systems must support application-specific policies that selectively drop data objects when network or application buffers overflow.In this paper we present a data-dissemination service, PACK, which allows applications to specify customized data-reduction policies. These policies define how to discard or summarize data flows wherever buffers overflow on the dissemination path, notably at the mobile hosts where applications often reside. The PACK service provides an overlay infrastructure to support mobile data sources and sinks, using application-specific data-reduction policies where necessary along the data path. We uniformly apply the data-stream “packing”packing abstraction to buffer overflow caused by network congestion, slow receivers, and the temporary disconnections caused by end-host mobility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an application example and experimental measurements.</div></div></div>

The results, however, are only as good as the models the simulation uses. One should not underestimate the importance of <em>validation</em>, as inaccurate models can lead to wrong conclusions. In this paper, we use direct-execution simulation to validate radio models used by ad-hoc routing protocols, against real-world experiments. This paper documents a common testbed that supports direct execution of a set of ad-hoc routing protocol implementations in a wireless network simulator. The testbed reads traces generated from real experiments, and uses them to drive direct-execution implementations of the routing protocols. Doing so we reproduce the same network conditions as in real experiments. By comparing routing behavior <em>measured</em> in real experiments with behavior <em>computed</em> by the simulation, we are able to validate the models of radio behavior upon which protocol behavior depends. We conclude that it is <em>possible</em> to have fairly accurate results using a simple radio model, but the routing behavior is quite sensitive to one of this model’s parameters. The implication is that one should i) use a more complex radio model that explicitly models point-to-point path loss, or ii) use measurements from an environment typical of the one of interest, or iii) study behavior over a range of environments to identify sensitivities.</div></div></div>

Also, new sensing technologies in pervasive computing make it possible to define context-sensitive rules, such as “allow database access only to staff who are currently located in the main office.” However, these rules, or the facts that are needed to verify authority, often involve sensitive context information. This paper presents a secure context-sensitive authorization system that protects confidential information in facts or rules. Furthermore, our system allows multiple hosts in a distributed environment to perform the evaluation of an authorization query in a collaborative way; we do not need a universally trusted central host that maintains all the context information. The core of our approach is to decompose a proof for making an authorization decision into a set of sub-proofs produced on multiple different hosts, while preserving the integrity and confidentiality policies of the mutually untrusted principals operating these hosts. We prove the correctness of our algorithm.</div></div></div>

As a result, many location predictors have been proposed in the literature, though few have been evaluated with empirical evidence. This paper reports on the results of the first extensive empirical evaluation of location predictors, using a two-year trace of the mobility patterns of over 6,000 users on Dartmouth’s campus-wide Wi-Fi wireless network.We implemented and compared the prediction accuracy of several location predictors drawn from two major families of domain-independent predictors, namely Markov-based and compression-based predictors. We found that low-order Markov predictors performed as well or better than the more complex and more space-consuming compression-based predictors. Predictors of both families fail to make a prediction when the recent context has not been previously seen. To overcome this drawback, we added a simple fallback feature to each predictor and found that it significantly enhanced its accuracy in exchange for modest effort. Thus the Order-2 Markov predictor with fallback was the best predictor we studied, obtaining a median accuracy of about 72% for users with long trace lengths. We also investigated a simplification of the Markov predictors, where the prediction is based not on the most frequently seen context in the past, but the most recent, resulting in significant space and computational savings. We found that Markov predictors with this recency semantics can rival the accuracy of standard Markov predictors in some cases. Finally, we considered several seemingly obvious enhancements, such as smarter tie-breaking and aging of context information, and discovered that they had little effect on accuracy. The paper ends with a discussion and suggestions for further work.</div></div></div>

Thus a resource-discovery service, which locates specific resources and establishes network connections as better resources become available, is necessary for those applications. The performance of the resource-discovery service is important when the applications are in a dynamic and mobile environment. In this thesis, however, we do not focus on the resource- discovery technology itself, but the evaluation of the scalability and mobility of the resource discovery module in Solar, a context fusion middleware. Solar has a naming service that provides resource discovery, since the resource names encode static and dynamic attributes. The results of our experiments show that Solar’s resource discovery performed generally well in a typical dynamic environment, although Solar can not be scaled as well as it should. And we identify the implementation issues related to that problem. We also discuss experience, insights, and lessons learned from our quantitative analysis of the experiment results.</div></div></div>

By prioritizing applications and publishing the cost of actions, it is possible for applications to achieve faster performance than in an environment where resources are evenly shared. We enforce the costs of actions through markets where user applications bid for computation from host machines.We represent applications as collections of mobile agents and introduce a distributed mechanism for allocating general computational priority to mobile agents. We derive a bidding strategy for an agent that plans expenditures given a budget and a series of tasks to complete. We also show that a unique Nash equilibrium exists between the agents under our allocation policy. We present simulation results to show that the use of our resource-allocation mechanism and expenditure-planning algorithm results in shorter mean job completion times compared to traditional mobile-agent resource allocation. We also observe that our resource-allocation policy adapts favorably to allocate overloaded resources to higher priority agents, and that agents are able to effectively plan expenditures even when faced with network delay and job-size estimation error.</div></div></div>

The back-end system executes these operators and constantly updates the context values, adjusting advertised names and informing applications about changes. We report experimental results from a prototype, using a modified version of the Intentional Naming System (INS) as the core directory service.</div></div></div>

The “Flat Earth” model of the world is surprisingly popular: all radios have circular range, have perfect coverage in that range, and travel on a two-dimensional plane. CMU’s ns-2 radio models are better but still fail to represent many aspects of realistic radio networks, including hills, obstacles, link asymmetries, and unpredictable fading. We briefly argue that key “axioms” of these types of propagation models lead to simulation results that do not adequately reflect real behavior of ad-hoc networks, and hence to network protocols that may not work well (or at all) in reality. We then present a set of 802.11 measurements that clearly demonstrate that these “axioms” are contrary to fact. The broad chasm between simulation and reality calls into question many of results from prior papers, and we summarize with a series of recommendations for researchers considering analytic or simulation models of wireless networks.</div></div></div>

A key challenge in this environment is to provide efficient access to data distributed across remote data servers. This dissertation explores some of the issues associated with I/O for wide-area distributed computing and describes an I/O system, called Armada, with the following features: a framework to allow application and dataset providers to flexibly compose graphs of processing modules that describe the distribution, application interfaces, and processing required of the dataset before or after computation; an algorithm to restructure application graphs to increase parallelism and to improve network performance in a wide-area network; and a hierarchical graph-partitioning scheme that deploys components of the application graph in a way that is both beneficial to the application and sensitive to the administrative policies of the different administrative domains. Experiments show that applications using Armada perform well in both low- and high-bandwidth environments, and that our approach does an exceptional job of hiding the network latency inherent in grid computing.</div></div></div>

On each machine, the agent interacts with stationary service agents and other resources to accomplish its task. In this chapter, we first make the case for mobile agents, discussing six strengths of mobile agents and the applications that benefit from these strengths. Although none of these strengths are unique to mobile agents, no competing technique shares all six. In other words, a mobile-agent system provides a single general framework in which a wide range of distributed applications can be implemented efficiently and easily.

After considering the D’Agents implementation, we present some recent performance and scalability experiments that compare D’Agent mobile agents with traditional client/server approaches.

In this paper we examine the tradeoffs faced when deciding whether to use mobile agents in a data-filtering application where numerous wireless clients filter information from a large data stream arriving across the wired network.

It became clear that the field should shift its emphasis toward mobile code, in all its forms, rather than to continue its narrow focus on mobile agents. Furthermore, we encourage the development of modular components, so that application designers may take advantage of code mobility without needing to rewrite their application to fit in a monolithic mobile-agent system. There are many potential applications that may productively use mobile code, but there is no “killer application” for mobile agents. Finally, we note that although security is an important and challenging problem, there are many applications and environments with security requirements well within the capability of existing mobile-code and mobile-agent frameworks.</div></div></div>

Due to the personal or proprietary nature of much of this context information, however, the infrastructure must limit access to context information to authorized persons. In this paper we propose a new access-control mechanism for event-based context-distribution infrastructures. The core of our approach is based on a conservative information-flow model of access control, but users may express discretionary relaxation of the resulting access-control list (ACL) by specifying relaxation functions. This combination of automatic ACL derivation and user-specified ACL relaxation allows access control to be determined and enforced in a decentralized, distributed system with no central administrator or central policy maker. It also allows users to express their personal balance between functionality and privacy. Finally, our infrastructure allows access-control policies to depend on context-sensitive roles, allowing great flexibility.We describe our approach in terms of a specific context-dissemination framework, the Solar system, although the same principles would apply to systems with similar properties.</div></div></div>

Ideally these devices communicate and share resources, but there is seldom motivation for a device’s owner to yield control to another user. We establish markets for computational resources to motivate principals to share resources with arbitrary users, to enforce priority in distributed systems, to provide flexible and rational limitations on the potential of an application, and to provide a lightweight structure to balance the workload over time and between devices. As proof of concept, we implement a structure software agents can use to discover and negotiate access to networked resources. The structure separates discovery, authentication, and consumption enforcement as separate orthogonal issues to give system designers flexibility.Mobile agents represent informational and computational flow. We develop mechanisms that distributively allocate computation among mobile agents in two settings. The first models a situation where users collectively own networked computing resources and require priority enforcement. We extend the allocation mechanism to allow resource reservation to mitigate utility volatility. The second, more general model relaxes the ownership assumption. We apply our computational market to an open setting where a principal’s chief concern is revenue maximization.Our simulations compare the performance of market-based allocation policies to traditional policies and relate the cost of ownership and consumption separation. We observe that our markets effectively prioritize applications’ performance, can operate under uncertainty and network delay, provide metrics to balance network load, and allow measurement of market-participation risk versus reservation-based computation.In addition to allocation problems, we investigate resource selection to optimize execution time. The problem is NP-complete if the costs and latencies are constant. Both metrics’ dependence on the chosen set complicates matters. We study how a greedy approach, a novel heuristic, and a shortest-constrained-path strategy perform in mobile-agent applications.Market-based computational-resource allocation fertilizes applications where previously there was a dearth of motive for or means of cooperation. The rationale behind mobile-agent performance optimization is also useful for resource allocation in general distributed systems where an application has a sequence of dependent tasks or when data collection is expensive.</div></div></div>

We argue for the use of markets to regulate agent systems. With market mechanisms, agents have the abilities to assess the cost of their actions, behave responsibly, and coordinate their resource usage both temporally and spatially.We discuss our market structure and mechanisms we have developed to foster secure exchange between agents and hosts. Additionally, we believe that certain agent applications encourage repeated interactions that benefit both agents and hosts, giving further reason for hosts to fairly accommodate agents. We apply our ideas to create a resource-allocation policy for mobile-agent systems, from which we derive an algorithm for a mobile agent to plan its expenditure and travel. With perfect information, the algorithm guarantees the agent’s optimal completion time.We relax the assumptions underlying our algorithm design and simulate our planning algorithm and allocation policy to show that the policy prioritizes agents by endowment, handles bursty workloads, adapts to situations where network resources are overextended, and that delaying agents’ actions does not catastrophically affect agents’ performance.</div></div></div>

The challenge is to allow applications flexible access to these sources, and yet scale to thousands of devices and sensors. In this paper we introduce our proposed infrastructure, Solar. In Solar, information sources produce events. Applications may subscribe to interesting sources directly, or they may instantiate and subscribe to a tree of operators that filter, transform, merge and aggregate events. Applications use a subscription language to describe the tree, based on event streams registered in a context-sensitive naming hierarchy. Solar is flexible: modular operators can be composed to produce new event streams. Solar is scalable: it distributes operators across hosts called Planets, and it re-uses common subgraphs in the operator network.</div></div></div>

We propose a system infrastructure, Solar, to meet these challenges. Solar uses a subscription-based operator graph abstraction and allows dynamic composition of stackable operators to manage ubiquitous information sources. After developing a set of diverse adaptive applications, we expect to identify fundamental techniques for context-aware adaptation. Our expectation is that Solar’s end-to-end support for information collection, dissemination, and utilization will make it easy to build adaptive applications for a ubiquitous mobile environment with many users and devices.</div></div></div>

Even if the multiprocessor is configured with sufficient I/O hardware, the file-system software often fails to provide the available bandwidth to the application. Although libraries and enhanced file-system interfaces can make a significant improvement, we believe that fundamental changes are needed in the file-server software. We propose a new technique, disk-directed I/O, to allow the disk servers to determine the flow of data for maximum performance. Our simulations show that tremendous performance gains are possible both for simple reads and writes and for an out-of-core application. Indeed, our disk-directed I/O technique provided consistent high performance that was largely independent of data distribution, obtained up to 93% of peak disk bandwidth, and was as much as 18 times faster than the traditional technique.</div></div></div>

We argue that a market-based approach where agents buy computational resources from their hosts solves many problems faced by mobile-agent systems.In our earlier work, we propose a policy for allocating general computational priority among agents posed as a competitive game for which we derive a unique computable Nash equilibrium. Here we improve on our earlier approach by implementing resource guarantees where mobile-agent hosts issue call options on computational resources. Call options allow an agent to reserve and guarantee the cost and time necessary to complete its itinerary before the agent begins execution.We present an algorithm based upon the binomial options-pricing model that estimates future congestion to allow hosts to evaluate call options; methods for agents to measure the risk associated with their performance and compare their expected utility of competing in the computational spot market with utilizing resource options; and test our theory with simulations to show that option trade reduces variance in agent completion times.</div></div></div>

Conventional systems manifest the hierarchy of typical administrative structure in the structure of their own mechanism. While natural for communication that follows hierarchical patterns, such systems interfere with naming and sharing that cross administrative boundaries, and therefore cause headaches for both users and administrators. I propose to organize resource naming and security, not around administrative domains, but around the sharing patterns of users.The dissertation is organized into four main parts. First, I discuss the challenges and tradeoffs involved in naming resources and consider a variety of existing approaches to naming.Second, I consider the architectural requirements for user-centric sharing. I evaluate existing systems with respect to these requirements.Third, to support the sharing architecture, I develop a formal logic of sharing that captures the notion of restricted delegation. Restricted delegation ensures that users can use the same mechanisms to share resources consistently, regardless of the origin of the resource, or with whom the user wishes to share the resource next. A formal semantics gives unambiguous meaning to the logic. I apply the formalism to the Simple Public Key Infrastructure and discuss how the formalism either supports or discourages potential extensions to such a system.Finally, I use the formalism to drive a user-centric sharing implementation for distributed systems. I show how this implementation enables end-to-end authorization, a feature that makes heterogeneous distributed systems more secure and easier to audit. Conventionally, gateway services that bridge administrative domains, add abstraction, or translate protocols typically impede the flow of authorization information from client to server. In contrast, end-to-end authorization enables us to build gateway services that preserve authorization information, hence we reduce the size of the trusted computing base and enable more effective auditing. I demonstrate my implementation and show how it enables end-to-end authorization across various boundaries. I measure my implementation and argue that its performance tracks that of similar authorization mechanisms without end-to-end structure.I conclude that my user-centric philosophy of naming and sharing benefits both users and administrators.</div></div></div>

Although the value of any network is dependent on both the number of users and the number of sites participating in the network, there is little motivation for systems to donate resources to arbitrary agents. We propose to remedy the problem by imposing an economic market on mobile-agent systems where agents purchase resources from host sites and sell services to users and other agents. Host sites accumulate revenues, which are distributed to users to be used to launch more agents. We argue for the use of markets to regulate mobile-agent systems and discuss open issues in implementing market-based mobile-agent systems.</div></div></div>

On each machine, the agent interacts with stationary service agents and other resources to accomplish its task. Mobile agents are particularly attractive in distributed information-retrieval applications. By moving to the location of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally, eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and reducing end-to-end latency. In this chapter, we first discuss the strengths of mobile agents, and argue that although none of these strengths are unique to mobile agents, no competing technique shares all of them. Next, after surveying several representative mobile-agent systems, we examine one specific information-retrieval application, searching distributed collections of technical reports, and consider how mobile agents can be used to implement this application efficiently and easily. Then we spend the bulk of the chapter describing two planning services that allow mobile agents to deal with dynamic network environments and information resources: (1) planning algorithms that let an agent choose the best migration path through the network, given its current task and the current network conditions, and (2) planning algorithms that tell an agent how to observe a changing set of documents in a way that detects changes as soon as possible while minimizing overhead. Finally, we consider the types of errors that can occur when information from multiple sources is merged and filtered, and argue that the structure of a mobile-agent application determines the extent to which these errors affect the final result.</div></div></div>

We used a parallel CPU, parallel I/O, out-of-core matrix-multiplication application to test the Vesta interface in both its ability to specify data access patterns and in its run-time efficiency.

First we discuss mechanisms existing in D’Agents for protecting an individual machine: (1) cryptographic authentication of the agent’s owner, (2) resource managers that make policy decisions based on the owner’s identity, and (3) secure execution environments for each language that enforce the decisions of the resource managers. Then we discuss our planned market-based approach for protecting machine groups. Finally we consider several (partial) solutions for protecting an agent from a malicious machine.</div></div></div>

Partially connected computers include mobile computers such as laptops and personal digital assistants as well as modem-connected home computers, all of which are often disconnected from the network. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of our mobile-agent system, Agent Tcl, and the specific features that support mobile computers and disconnected operation.

In this paper, we propose a system that allows each computer user to aggregate resources from multiple sites into his own single distributed virtual computer. Another difference between our design and typical single-system-image cluster designs is that almost all of the aggregation and abstraction functions in our design are implemented in the user’s environment, so the end user can replace and reconfigure them at will.</div></div></div>

Even if the multiprocessor is configured with sufficient I/O hardware, the file-system software often fails to provide the available bandwidth to the application. Although libraries and enhanced file-system interfaces can make a significant improvement, we believe that fundamental changes are needed in the file-server software. We propose a new technique, disk-directed I/O, to allow the disk servers to determine the flow of data for maximum performance. Our simulations show that tremendous performance gains are possible both for simple reads and writes and for an out-of-core application. Indeed, our disk-directed I/O technique provided consistent high performance that was largely independent of data distribution, obtained up to 93% of peak disk bandwidth, and was as much as 18 times faster than the traditional technique.</div></div></div>

However, because network conditions vary from connection to connection, using Internet resources from a mobile platform is a major challenge. Mobile agents are one solution. A mobile agent is an autonomous program that can move from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network under its own control. It can suspend its execution at any point, transport itself to a new machine, and resume execution on the new machine from the point at which it left off. On each machine, it interacts with service agents and other resources to accomplish its task, returning to its home site with a final result when that task is finished.Agent Tcl is a mobile-agent system whose agents can be written in Tcl, Java, and Scheme. Agent Tcl has extensive navigation and communication services, security mechanisms, and debugging and tracking tools. In this article we focus on Agent Tcl’s architecture and security mechanisms, its RPC system, and its docking system, which lets an agent move transparently among mobile computers, regardless of when they are connected to the network.</div></div></div>

To simplify address-space management, some have claimed that a 64-bit address space is sufficiently large that there is no need to ever re-use addresses. Unfortunately, there has been no data to either support or refute these claims, or to aid in the design of appropriate address-space management policies. In this paper, we present the results of extensive kernel-level tracing of the workstations on our campus, and discuss the implications for single-address-space operating systems. We found that single-address-space systems will probably not outgrow the available address space, but only if reasonable space-allocation policies are used, and only if the system can adapt as larger address spaces become available.</div></div></div>

As a result, the I/O system is often the limiting factor of application performance. Several new parallel file systems have been developed in recent years, each promising better performance for some class of parallel applications. As we gain experience with parallel computing, and parallel file systems in particular, it becomes increasingly clear that a single solution does not suit all applications. For example, it appears to be impossible to find a single appropriate interface, caching policy, file structure, or disk management strategy. Furthermore, the proliferation of file-system interfaces and abstractions make application portability a significant problem.We propose that the traditional functionality of parallel file systems be separated into two components: a fixed core that is standard on all platforms, encapsulating only primitive abstractions and interfaces, and a set of high-level libraries to provide a variety of abstractions and application-programmer interfaces (APIs). We think of this approach as the “RISC”RISC of parallel file-system design.We present our current and next-generation file systems as examples of this structure. Their features, such as a three-dimensional file structure, strided read and write interfaces, and I/O-node programs, are specifically designed with the flexibility and performance necessary to support a wide range of applications.</div></div></div>

Contrary to the expectations of the designers of current parallel file systems, the workloads on those systems are dominated by requests to read and write small pieces of data. Furthermore, rather than being accessed sequentially and contiguously, as in uniprocessor and supercomputer workloads, files in multiprocessor file systems are accessed in regular, structured, but non-contiguous patterns.Based on our observations of multiprocessor workloads, we have designed Galley, a new parallel file system that is intended to efficiently support realistic scientific multiprocessor workloads. In this work, we introduce Galley and discuss its design and implementation. We describe Galley’s new three-dimensional file structure and discuss how that structure can be used by parallel applications to achieve higher performance. We introduce several new data-access interfaces, which allow applications to explicitly describe the regular access patterns we found to be common in parallel file system workloads. We show how these new interfaces allow parallel applications to achieve tremendous increases in I/O performance. Finally, we discuss how Galley’s new file structure and data-access interfaces can be useful in practice.</div></div></div>

Many multiprocessor file systems provide applications with a conventional Unix-like interface, allowing the application to access multiple disks transparently. This interface conceals the parallelism within the file system, increasing the ease of programmability, but making it difficult or impossible for sophisticated programmers and libraries to use knowledge about their I/O needs to exploit that parallelism. In addition to providing an insufficient interface, most current multiprocessor file systems are optimized for a different workload than they are being asked to support. We introduce Galley, a new parallel file system that is intended to efficiently support realistic scientific multiprocessor workloads. We discuss Galley’s file structure and application interface, as well as the performance advantages offered by that interface.</div></div></div>

The real power of our Agent RPC comes from a client-server binding mechanism based on flexible IDL matching and from support for multiple simultaneous bindings. Our agents are programmed in Agent Tcl; we describe how the Tcl implementation made RPC particularly easy to implement.

The result, DAPPLE, is a C++ class library designed to provide the illusion of a data-parallel programming language on conventional hardware and with conventional compilers. DAPPLE defines <em>Vectors</em> and <em>Matrices</em> as basic classes, with all the usual C++ operators overloaded to provide elementwise arithmetic.

Cost-effective solutions demand that a system make effective use of all of its resources. Many MIMD multiprocessors today, however, distinguish between “compute”compute and “I/O”I/O nodes, the latter having attached disks and being dedicated to running the file-system server. This static division of responsibilities simplifies system management but does not necessarily lead to the best performance in workloads that need a different balance of computation and I/O.Of course, computational processes sharing a node with a file-system service may receive less CPU time, network bandwidth, and memory bandwidth than they would on a computation-only node. In this paper we begin to examine this issue experimentally. We found that high-performance I/O does not necessarily require substantial CPU time, leaving plenty of time for application computation. There were some complex file-system requests, however, which left little CPU time available to the application. (The impact on network and memory bandwidth still needs to be determined.) For applications (or users) that cannot tolerate an occasional interruption, we recommend that they continue to use only compute nodes. For tolerant applications needing more cycles than those provided by the compute nodes, we recommend that they take full advantage of <em>both</em><em>both</em>both compute and I/O nodes for computation, and that operating systems should make this possible.</div></div></div>

Instead of continuing along the evolutionary path by introducing parallel computation “top down”top down (first in special junior-senior level courses), we are taking a radical approach and introducing parallelism at the earliest possible stages of instruction. Specifically, we are developing a completely new freshman-level course on data structures that integrates parallel computation naturally, and retains the emphasis on laboratory instruction. This will help to steer our curriculum as expeditiously as possible toward parallel computing.Our approach is novel in three distinct and essential ways. First, we will teach parallel computing to freshmen in a course designed from beginning to end to do so. Second, we will motivate the course with examples from scientific computation. Third, we use multimedia and visualization as instructional aids. We have two primary objectives: to begin a reform of our undergraduate curriculum with an laboratory-based freshman course on parallel computation, and to produce tools and methodologies that improve student understanding of the basic principles of parallel computing.</div></div></div>

This processing can be accomplished by using a traditional client-server network interface, which constrains the client to the set of queries supported by the server, or requires the server to send all data to the client for processing. The former is inflexible; the latter is inefficient. Transportable agents, which support the movement of the client computation to the location of the remote resource, have the potential to be more flexible and more efficient. Transportable agents are capable of suspending their execution, transporting themselves to another host on a network, and resuming execution from the point at which they were suspended. Transportable agents consume fewer network resources and can support systems that do not have permanent network connections, such as mobile computers and personal digital assistants. We describe a prototype transportable-agent implementation that facilitates research in this area. Agents are written in a script language that supports agent relocation, and the language is processed at each host by an agent interpreter. Electronic mail is the current transport mechanism and we plan to explore others. We present a technical-report searching agent as a demonstration of the capabilities of our prototype implementation.</div></div></div>

The result, DAPPLE, is a C++ class library designed to provide the illusion of a data-parallel programming language on conventional hardware and with conventional compilers. DAPPLE defines <em>Vectors</em> and <em>Matrices</em> as basic classes, with all the usual C++ operators overloaded to provide elementwise arithmetic.

Several architectural trends have led some to propose configuring systems so that all processors are used for application processing, even those with disks attached. We examine this idea experimentally, focusing on the impact of remote I/O requests on local computational processes. We found that in an efficient file system the I/O processors can transfer data at near peak speeds with little CPU overhead, leaving substantial CPU power for running applications. On the other hand, we found that some complex file-system features could require substantial CPU overhead. Thus, for a multiprocessor system to obtain good I/O and computational performance on a mix of applications, the file system (both operating system and libraries) must be prepared to adapt their policies to changing conditions.</div></div></div>

Typical proposals require the single address space to contain all process-private data, shared data, and stored files. To simplify management of an address space where stale pointers make it difficult to re-use addresses, some have claimed that a 64-bit address space is sufficiently large that there is no need to ever re-use addresses. Unfortunately, there has been no data to either support or refute these claims, or to aid in the design of appropriate address-space management policies. In this paper, we present the results of extensive kernel-level tracing of the workstations in our department, and discuss the implications for single-address-space operating systems. We found that single-address-space systems will not outgrow the available address space, but only if reasonable space-allocation policies are used, and only if the system can adapt as larger address spaces become available.</div></div></div>

To satisfy the large and growing I/O requirements of some parallel scientific applications, we need parallel file systems that can provide high-bandwidth and high-volume data transfer between the I/O subsystem and thousands of processors.Design of such high-performance parallel file systems depends on a thorough grasp of the expected workload. So far there have been no comprehensive usage studies of multiprocessor file systems. Our CHARISMA project intends to fill this void. The first results from our study involve an iPSC/860 at NASA Ames. This paper presents results from a different platform, the CM-5 at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The CHARISMA studies are unique because we collect information about every individual read and write request and about the entire mix of applications running on the machines.The results of our trace analysis lead to recommendations for parallel file system design. First, the file system should support efficient concurrent access to many files, and I/O requests from many jobs under varying load condit ions. Second, it must efficiently manage large files kept open for long periods. Third, it should expect to see small requests, predominantly sequential access patterns, application-wide synchronous access, no concurrent file-sharing between jobs, appreciable byte and block sharing between processes within jobs, and strong interprocess locality. Finally, the trace data suggest that node-level write caches and collective I/O request interfaces may be useful in certain environments.</div></div></div>

Although file system software can transparently provide high-performance access to parallel disks, a new file system interface is needed to facilitate parallel access to a file from a parallel application. We describe the difficulties faced when using the conventional (Unix-like) interface in parallel applications, and then outline ways to extend the conventional interface to provide convenient access to the file for parallel programs, while retaining the traditional interface for programs that have no need for explicitly parallel file access. Our interface includes a single naming scheme, a <em>multiopen</em> operation, local and global file pointers, mapped file pointers, logical records, <em>multifiles</em>, and logical coercion for backward compatibility.</div></div></div>

Trends show that the difference in the speed of disk hardware and the speed of processors is increasing, with I/O severely limiting the performance of otherwise fast machines. This widening access-time gap is known as the “I/O bottleneck crisis.”I/O bottleneck crisis. One solution to the crisis, suggested by many researchers, is to use many disks in parallel to increase the overall bandwidth.This dissertation studies some of the file system issues needed to get high performance from parallel disk systems, since parallel hardware alone cannot guarantee good performance. The target systems are large MIMD multiprocessors used for scientific applications, with large files spread over multiple disks attached in parallel. The focus is on automatic caching and prefetching techniques. We show that caching and prefetching can transparently provide the power of parallel disk hardware to both sequential and parallel applications using a conventional file system interface. We also propose a new file system interface (compatible with the conventional interface) that could make it easier to use parallel disks effectively.Our methodology is a mixture of implementation and simulation, using a software testbed that we built to run on a BBN GP1000 multiprocessor. The testbed simulates the disks and fully implements the caching and prefetching policies. Using a synthetic workload as input, we use the testbed in an extensive set of experiments. The results show that prefetching and caching improved the performance of parallel file systems, often dramatically.</div></div></div>

The testbed ran on Duke’s 64-processor Butterfly GP1000. The model we used had a disk attached to every processor, and that each file was striped across all disks. Of course, Duke’s GP1000 had only one real disk, so our testbed simulated its disks. The implementation and some of the policies were dependent on the shared-memory nature of the machine; for example, there was a single shared file cache accessible to all processors. We found several policies that were successful at prefetching in a variety of parallel file-access patterns.</div></div></div>

Results of these experiments suggest that 1) the hit ratio, the accepted measure in traditional caching studies, may not be an adequate measure of performance when the workload consists of parallel computations and parallel file access patterns, 2) caching with prefetching can significantly improve the hit ratio and the average time to perform an I/O operation, and 3) an improvement in overall execution time has been observed in most cases.
