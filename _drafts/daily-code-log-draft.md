Ideally, all (or most) of the work should be on ***real projects*** that solve ***real problems***.
I'll record notes and progress in this log.
Topics to write about include:
    today's progress,
    miscellaneous thoughts,
    links to deployed work,
    and so forth.
For more details on the 100 Days of Code Challenge,
    see the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code).

Remember:

> No more small stuff - work on stuff that matters!

> Give up your perfectionism - ship now. improve later.

> No more multi-tasking and wasting time!

> Start as an amateur, seek coaching/teaching/education, do the hard stuff (what you -want- to do; what no one else wants to do),
be consistent, create structure/patterns/habits, rest when you need it, repeat!

To Travis in the future (or others that read this):

## Blog Post Ideas

* *First, any project is fair game for a post!*
* **My Apps & The Network.** A question I always have with new software (be they pre-compiled apps or open source software that I build/run):
"how does this software use the network?" A first step is really to ask "does it use the network at all." If it shouldn't, but you find it does, that is a big red flag! But if it should use the network, I'd then like to know if it is doing only that which it should do and nothing more. Do you know how to answer this question? Think about your own app, for example. Do you use Evernote? What network activity does Evernote drum up? Do you use Spotify? With whom is your Spotify app connecting to? And what data is sent? There are ways to answer (at least some of) these questions - in fact, this is the topic of this post.
    * Somewhat inspired by the "Puppy Weather" app that Greg was running on his smartphone. It's free. It's super cute. But what is it really doing?

## R1D1: January 3, 2018 (W)

To get the ball rolling on this challenge I spun up a simple tribute page dedicated to people
    I'm interested in learning more about (both past and present figures).
This project is some what inspired by the
    [FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) (with some creative liberties).
I'm increasingly interested in a variety of people (computer scientists, theologians, presidents, etc.)
    and would like to have my own sort of reference page to people I've learned about or would like to learn more about.
Thus, the page is a tribute to a collection of people, rather than one person.
Perhaps I'll implement a break-out page for each person that I do in-depth learning on in the future? We'll see.

    The tribute page uses some recent knowledge I've obtained about CSS Grid for page layouts.

**Tribute Project Link:** [https://traviswp.github.io/toys/tribute/](https://traviswp.github.io/toys/tribute/).

## R1D2: January 4, 2018 (Th)

Playing with front end development a bit.
Specifically, wrapping up some tinkering I was doing on a Slack mock-up page written completely in HTML and CSS (no Javascript) -
    [inspired by CS52 @ Dartmouth](http://cs52.me/assignments/lab/landing-page/).

**Mock Slack v0 Code:**
[https://github.com/traviswp/treters.me/tree/gh-pages/mock-slack-v0](https://github.com/traviswp/treters.me/tree/gh-pages/mock-slack-v0).

**Mock Slack v0 Live:**
[http://treters.me/mock-slack-v0/](http://treters.me/mock-slack-v0/).
*NOTE: Sometimes you have to re-size the page to get the background image and gradient to render... I'm not sure why... and I don't actually feel like investing more time into this particular issue.*

## R1D3: January 5, 2018 (F)

More of what I was doing yesterday.
This time, however, I wanted to see if I liked working with the page layouts using
    both CSS Flex (1D aspects of the page) and CSS Grid (2D aspects of the page).
I captured an updated version of this site in a `mock-slack-v1` subdirectory.

**Mock Slack v1 Code:**
[https://github.com/traviswp/treters.me/tree/gh-pages/mock-slack-v1](https://github.com/traviswp/treters.me/tree/gh-pages/mock-slack-v1).

**Mock Slack v1 Live:**
[http://treters.me/mock-slack-v1/](http://treters.me/mock-slack-v1/). NOTE: Sometimes you have to re-size the page to get the background image and gradient to render... I'm not sure why...

## R1D4: January 6, 2018 (S)

Wrapped up my time working through the [edX - Introduction to NodeJS](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV283x+2T2017/course/) online course.
Specifically, I finished a project that creates a MongDB database and merges two JSON files to make a complete customer record.
Over the holidays I worked through most of the course which covered NodeJS basics, Express, and MongoDB.

## R1D5: January 7, 2018 (Su)

Day off! My practice was not touching the computer at all (except for maybe a tiny bit of email).

## R1D6: January 8, 2018 (M)

Worked through the [SA3 Webpack + Babel + eslint](http://cs52.me/assignments/sa/starterpack/) short assignment.

## R1D7: January 9, 2018 (Tu)

Lots of reading...

## R1D8: January 10, 2018 (W)

Lots of reading...

## R1D9: January 11, 2018 (Th)

I'm interested in layouts and CSS Grid seems to be quite popular as of late.
I've got some reading and little projects queued up to learn about how Flexbox and Grid can "play together" to create great layouts.

Today I worked on [a project to replicate Medium's article layout with CSS Grid (my version)](http://treters.me/medium-article-grid-layout/)
based on *[How to recreate Medium’s article layout with CSS Grid](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-recreate-mediums-article-layout-with-css-grid-b4608792bad1)*.

Offline / NYC Vacation

## R1D20: January 22, 2018 (M)

Developing a browser plugin.

I will begin by working through some of the Mozilla Developer Network resources on
    [Web Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions).
