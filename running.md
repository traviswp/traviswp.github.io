## TODO: Calculators

Option 1 (basic): add total distance, plus time (in hours, minutes, seconds) => avg. pace/mile
    - bonus: extend to support kilometers, not just miles.
Option 2: Add mile splits (mile 1, mile 2, ...) and have it sum them => total time, avg. pace/mile
    - allow option to "select" a subset of the miles, and compute total time/avg. pace/mile just for the selected miles

distance_in_miles = 5;
hours = 0;
minutes = 0;
seconds = 0;
total_time_in_seconds = (hours * 60 * 60) + (minutes * 60) + (seconds * 1); -->

### (#4) Via Marathon (DNF)
*September 9th, 2018 -
[[results](https://results.rmraces.live/Via-Marathon/events/2018/lehigh-valley-health-network-via-marathon/results)]
[[strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/1830601967)]
[[watch Travis and Mary run the Via Marathon 2018 - Strava Flyby](https://labs.strava.com/flyby/viewer/#1830601967?c=dr4qgvu7&z=D&t=1RbF_O&a=78QcbU9sGm0)]*

It was Boston or Bust... and it was Bust.
I was hopeful going into the race, but I was also on the fence as to whether or not I thought it was going to happen.
The first 10 or so miles were good, though I could tell that my hip flexors were getting really tired, really fast.
(Side Note: I ran with two awesome guys from State College through about mile 10 or 11;
    they were marathon veterans, and were super nice and encouraging and made jokes about all sorts of stuff that we saw as we were running - shout out to them for making those miles enjoyable!)
I decided I had banked some time and that I could back off a little around miles 11-13.
My hip flexors were all but gone at that point.
(Cramped? Stiff? Hard to say. All I know is that they weren't helping me pick my legs up anymore.)
As a result, I started running more with my hips/butt, but developed sharp pains in my right hip pretty quick.
(Some blips in the pace graph on Strava show me stopping to walk a little, trying to massage the muscles but keep moving.)
I was able to run with the hip pain for miles 13-23, and I was on pace through about 18 miles (slowing down 17-18, but still on target with the time I had banked up front).
I was pretty sure between 18-23 that I was slipping off pace and that a Boston Qualifier (BQ) wasn't going to happen.
With my hip hurting, I began thinking: 'even if I finish, I'm going to be disappointed with the time, *and* I'm probably going to hurt my hip more;'
    an increase in the sharpness in my hip ultimately led to me stopping at about mile 23.

**Looking Forward:**
I'm disappointed I didn't hit my goal of getting a BQ.
I'm clearly still trying to figure out what I need to do in my training to get my body in a place to handle the distance/pace.
Aerobically I felt pretty good, so I suspect that the problem is that I didn't have enough training/miles at a pace that was close enough to my goal marathon pace.
Something to remember for next time...
I still got my eye on you BQ. I'll see you another day...

Even with all of the disappointment, there are so many things to take heart in:
God answered so many prayers leading up to this day (e.g., my health, Mary's health, confidence, low temperatures on race day);
I get to spend so much quality time with my best friend;
I've learned *so much* in the past 6 months about running and training;
I'm healthier (e.g., diet is better, lower blood pressure, lost weight, no injuries);
I'm happier when I run;
New Hampshire/Vermont is such a beautiful place to train (and PA was such a beautiful place to race!);
We are so blessed to have these incredible bodies that can do so much;
And volunteers at races are so amazing! They are generous and gracious and so supportive.
I'm so grateful that I get to walk (run?) out this journey with so many amazing people and in so many great places.

*"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."* - Thomas Edison

(^^^) A quote M shared with me the day before the race (from her running notebook).
Likewise, I realize that I have not failed (though it is hard in the short term to escape the feeling that I have).
I have found (not quite 10,000, but) many ways that won't work; but I've also found many things that I think will work.
As long as I'm healthy and have good people around me and continually trying,
    I (we!) have so much opportunity ahead of us to find more 'ways that won't work' (and hopefully, ways that will work!).

**Training Background:**
It is worth noting that I began doing most of my training in accordance with the [Maffetone (MAF) Method](https://philmaffetone.com/what-is-maf/) in July.
Basically, this equated to most of my runs being done with a HR monitor, where my HR was at or below 152 (my "MAF number").
I was really enjoying progress (as gauged by [a couple of aerobic tests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KV7-Jj6z1sFdLgS2WxpIS7vLblWPOVAQLqPu0ZVeRNQ/edit#gid=0).)
But, it seemed that my aerobic progress stalled in mid or late July --- when we went back west for summer vacation --- and never really bounced back.
Training runs regressed to 8:45/mile and slower for pretty much all of my training runs in August. Not sure why...
    my best guesses is that it had something to do with a combination of stress from gearing up for my thesis proposal and the anticipation of the race.
(It didn't help that it was unbelievably humid and warm here in the summer, but it was humid in June and July as well when I was making progress.)
Overall, I really believe in this methodology though.
I feel better and I got through the entirety of my most recent training cycle without any injuries.
I think I just need more time and less stressful conditions (though, as a grad student, this is hard to avoid altogether...).
I'm looking forward to the coming year where I plan to spend *many* months training according to the MAF Method.

### (#3) Via Marathon (03:09:27)
*September 10, 2017 - [[results](https://results.chronotrack.com/event/results/event/event-32681)] [[strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/1178239615)]*

I wasn't thrilled with how the Maine Coast Marathon went so I thought I'd try to sneak in one more attempt at a BQ before the 2018 deadline (only about 4 months after Maine!).
We found this marathon kind of by chance, but we read great things about it.

WHAT A PERFECT DAY!
Mary drove out to cheer me on (I had flown into Allentown, PA on my way back from a conference at UIUC).
It was a beautiful course, there was perfect weather, and I had a great pack of guys to run with for about 10 miles.
Everything was going according to plan;
I started out running a little over 7-minute/mile pace to ease into the race;
I settled into sub-7-minute pace after a few miles and felt great.
I went through the half-marathon with a PR (1:30:10)

Cramps and fatigue started setting in around mile 18 and it got pretty bad, pretty fast.
The wheels fell off at mile 21.
I'm bummed I didn't go sub-3:05 but it was an awesome race.
What do you do? All is well. Maybe next time :)

### (#2) Maine Coast Marathon - My First (Accidental) Ultra Marathon... (3:14:55)
*May 14, 2017 - [[results](https://my.racewire.com/results/33401/37916)] [[strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/987404829)]*

A Travis, a noreaster, and a mistaken volunteer walk into a marathon...
26.7 miles later, a Travis finishes with a 3:14:55 official time (3:11:00 for the actual 26.2).

My training was much better this time around, albeit not perfect.
It was a *realll* cold day, with high winds.
About one-third of the race is run along the coast and we were quite exposed to the wind coming in off the ocean.
I got to run a good portion of the race with Mary and Greg (the first half or so).
Right around mile 12, a misinformed volunteer sent runners off-course, down a long road.
Of course the road was down hill, so upon reaching the end --- where there were no official course markers --- we simply turned around and had to run back up hill.
This really got in my head.
I got a pretty bad side-ache shortly after this and it was struggling to draw in a full breath of air;
it was about this time that I fell off Mary and Greg.
In fact, Greg *really* took off at this point.
Mary was up ahead and I was chasing her for a while... until all of a sudden she popped out of the woods and started running with me :)
We ran together for a short while, but by this point, my pace had slowed and Mary pulled away.
We all finished. We were all cold. We didn't even stick around to drink our free beer.
We proceeded to go back to the hotel and destroy a couple of pizzas and lay around.
What a day.

### (#1) Burlington Marathon (DNF)
*May 29, 2016 -  [[results](http://www.coolrunning.com/results/16/vt/May29_28thPe_set1.shtml)]*

A day that can only be described as one heaping pile of humble pie.
I went in cocky, injured, and under-trained.
My days of competitive running in high school and college made me think running 7-minute miles would be no big thing.
It was extremely hot (and shortly after I dropped out, the race was actually stopped due to dangerous temperatures).
I overheated and almost dropped out by about 10k into the race.
Some nice volunteers put ice on my neck and gave me water on the side of the road.
After some minutes of sitting and cooling down and catching my breath, I decided to try to run some more.
I slogged through the half-marathon mark and dropped out.

Even though it was a terrible day for running (at least for me), I fell in love with the city of Burlington and its people.
Out of the kindness of their hearts, people setup personal tables in their yards and gave away their own fruit and water and turned on sprinklers to try to help runners.
Thank you Burlington, VT, for making such a hard day into such a beautiful memory.
