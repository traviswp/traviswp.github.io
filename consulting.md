title: "Let's Work Together!"
---

I'm currently open to work engagements.

If you are interested in discussing opportunities and/or working together, reach out at {{ site.data.settings.gmail }}.

My consulting expertise spans a few high-demand areas:
- Code mentorships
- Codebase audits
- Best practices in teamwork and software development lifecycle issues (e.g., agile, SDLC, bug bounty programs)
- Software security and some freelance software development (particularly Linux-based apps and mobile apps)
- DevOps & SecDevOps (e.g., automation, managing virtual machines and containers, CI/CD)

> My research and interests in consulting engagements are highly aligned with the philosophy of "security by design".
I believe that attention to security-related issues needs to be considered from the start, with robust architecture design,
and must continue from the ground up, across the whole system:
from the device, communication stack, and cloud backends, to user-facing interfaces.
