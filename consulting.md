title: "Let's Work Together!"
---

I'm currently open to work engagements.

If you are interested in discussing opportunities and/or working together, reach out at {{ site.data.settings.gmail }}.

My consulting expertise spans a few high-demand areas:

- Advising
  - General and technical advising (e.g., secure software development)
  - Best practices in teamwork and software development lifecycle issues (e.g., agile, SDLC, bug bounty programs)
- R&D
  - Development of proof-of-concepts (PoC), prototypes, and tooling (e.g., security, automation)
  - Code assessments and pentesting
- Education & Research
  - Code & education mentorships
  - Advising for academic & research programs oriented around cybersecurity

My research and interests in consulting engagements are highly aligned with the philosophy of "security by design".
I believe that attention to security-related issues needs to be considered from the start, with robust architecture design,
and must continue from the ground up, across the whole system:
from the device, communication stack, and cloud backends, to user-facing interfaces.
