title: Projects

Over the years I've had the chance to work on some fun projects and I've taken some fascinating courses.
This page is dedicated to highlighting some of my computer science and mathematics projects,
be they research-oriented, purely programming, writing, or something else.

Regarding projects with code, I haven't provided links to the code itself in all cases.
This is mostly out of respect for professors as some projects are still actively used at Western and Dartmouth;
therefore, I didn't want to post solutions online.
If you are curious about any code (and aren't taking a relevant class), get in touch and I can most likely share some code.
