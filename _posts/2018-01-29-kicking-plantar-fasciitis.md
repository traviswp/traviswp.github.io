I think I have Plantar Fasciitis...

## What's The Problem?

In fact, I'm fairly confident I have (or am developing) a bad case of plantar fasciitis
    in **both** of my feet!
I admit that this is a self-diagnosis but I've arrived at this after a lot of
    discomfort and pain, reading, watching videos, and talking with fellow runners in our club team.
I've had tightness in my heels and arches before, but never to the extent that I do now.

So what makes this different? Why do I now think I've got this plantar fasciitis thing?
I feel really uncomfortable (sometimes even painful) tightness in my heels
    and into the arches of my feet.
This is particularly noticeable in the morning when I wake up and first get out of bed,
    which I've heard is a reliable "tell" of Plantar Fasciitis.
I feel noticeable tightness *during* running, mostly when I push off during my stride.
I also experience painful tightness *after* running
    (e.g., when getting up after sitting down for a little bit).

All of this finally motivated me to stop running for a little while.
I bet you didn't think I'd say that, right?
*Motivated me to __stop__ running*.
But something needed to change.
Plus, I don't have any races in the immediate future, so a little R&R might be just what I need!

During this time I set out to learn more about what the problem is and what I can do about it.
My goal in writing this article is to share some of my findings with other club members in the hope that it would benefit others.

## What I'm Reading & Watching...

I've found some particularly insightful videos and articles.
Web searches turn up many, *many* results,
    but there is a lot of redundancy out there (as well as a lot of unhelpful stuff).
Here are a couple of my findings that I've bookmarked in my web browser so I can
    re-read/re-watch them:

* [Plantar Fasciitis](https://www.runnersworld.com/plantar-fasciitis) - An article from Runner's World.
* [Arch Enemy - Five simple stretches and exercises that can cure & prevent plantar fasciitis](https://www.runnersworld.com/the-body-shop/arch-enemy) - Another article from Runner's World.

The exercises and stretches I describe next are largely a summary of information
    that I've obtained from reading these articles and watching the videos on their respective websites.

## What I'm Doing...

I try to ice and heat the bottoms of my feet at least once a day.
We have a rice bag which I'll heat up for a couple of minutes and then just put my feet on top of it
    (plus it is a nice way to warm up your feet in the winter time!)
We also have an ice pack which I'll roll up and put under my feet
    (not as nice for warming up in the winter time...).

In addition to icing and heating to reduce inflammation and stimulate blood flow,
    respectively, I do some other stuff.

For instance, there are a number of ***exercises*** that I'm trying to do most days, up to 3 sets of 10 reps:

1. **Calf Raises.**
*(Strengthens the tendons in your heels and calf muscles, which support your arch).*
Raise up on the balls of your feet as high as possible. Slowly lower down.
Progress to doing the raises on stairs with heels hanging off, and then to single-leg raises.
Most mornings I do these in the shower.

2. **Step Stretch.**
*(Improves flexibility in your Achilles tendon and calf—when these areas become tight,
    the arch gets painfully overloaded).*
Stand at the edge of a step, toes on the step, heels hanging off.
Lower your heels down, past the step, then raise back up to the start position.

3. **Doming.**
*(Works the arch muscles and the tibialis posterior (in the calf and foot) to control excess pronation).*
While standing, press your toes downward into the ground while keeping the heel planted
    so that your foot forms an arch or dome.
Hold for one or two seconds, then release.

4. **Towel Curls.**
*(Works the toe-flexor muscles that run along your arch to increase overall foot strength).*
Lay a small hand towel on the floor, and place one foot on the towel.
Using just your toes, scrunch the towel toward you, hold,
    then slowly push the towel away from you back to the start position.

There are also a couple of specific ***stretches*** that I'm doing:

1. **Achilles Tendon Stretch.**
Stand with your affected foot behind your healthy one.
Point the toes of the back foot toward the heel of the front foot, and lean into a wall.
Bend the front knee and keep the back knee straight, heel firmly planted on the floor.
Hold for a count of 10.

2. **Plantar Fascia Stretch.**
Sit down, and place the foot with heel pain across your knee.
Using the hand on the side affected by plantar fasciitis,
    pull your toes back toward your shin until you feel a stretch in your arch.
Run your thumb along your foot—you should feel tension.
Hold for a count of 10.
*I really feel this one!*

For a more casual stretch, as I'm sitting and working or reading, I put a lacrosse ball under my foot and roll the ball around to massage my arches and heel.

## Looking Forward

I'm not better yet but things aren't getting worse.
That's good, right?

I started writing this article two or three weeks into my time off.
Surprisingly, none of the advice I read instructed runners to take time off---most everything I've read/watched
    is oriented around the exercises, stretches, and icing and heating.
But if you can afford to take some time off, I don't see how that could hurt.

After a little over three weeks of no running, I was itching to see how things felt.
The tightness was still there but it wasn't as sharp.
The key, I think, is that my "time off" wasn't just sitting around.
I was started back into a spin class, I've been doing yoga with Mary, I've been doing a fair amount of walking,
    and of course,
    I've been doing all of the stretches and exercises I mentioned above.
Thus, my time off was more of an "active recovery," if you will.

Wish me luck! If you are reading this and you have any other tips or tricks (UVRC coaches? Those formerly encumbered with Plantar Fasciitis?),
    I'd love to hear them!
You can drop me a line personally (traviswp@gmail.com) or maybe write something to share with the whole group in the next newsletter! :)
If you are reading this and some of what I've described is resonating with you
    (i.e., you think you might have Plantar Fasciitis), I hope this was helpful and gave you some things to try out.

Happy running!
