Hi family and friends -

Whether you‚Äôve heard about the Equifax breach or not,
    please read on to learn about how to protect yourself.
I‚Äôve been trying to sort out what Mary and I should do and as I compiled all of our actions
    I figured I‚Äôd share some notes in case anyone else hasn‚Äôt yet given this much thought.

If you know about this issue
    (discussed in <a href="#problem">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the Problem‚Äù</a>)
    and only want a simple description of what to do, see the
    <a href="#steps">‚ÄúNo-Nonsense List of Steps.‚Äù</a>
There is also an <a href="#appendix">‚ÄúAppendix‚Äù</a> to this message
    (‚Äúwhat the heck, Travis, an appendix?!‚Äù) with more information for the curious reader.





<!-- Problem -->
<h1 id="problem">What‚Äôs the Problem?</h1>

You may have heard about the big [Equifax data breach][1].
Data that was stolen includes things like
    Social Security numbers,
    home addresses,
    credit card numbers (and security codes),
    drivers license numbers,
    and birth dates.
The company estimates that the data of 143 million people were exposed,
    which is roughly half the US population.
Even if you think you don‚Äôt have any affiliation with Equifax, you might.
They have loads of information on loads of people.
It is unclear who exactly has been ‚Äúcompromised,"
    but given the scale of the breach and the value of the data,
    most people out there are saying its best to assume you are affected.
Equifax released a tool that enabled people to check if they were affected
    but the tool is... not good.
Indeed many sources online say something to the tune of:
*"Equifax's hack checker seems to be broken.
We recommend that anyone with a credit history assume they were affected"* [[CNET][2]].

What follows is a no-nonsense list of steps to take
    (this is what Mary and I have done - take that for what it is worth).
The <a href="#appendix">‚ÄúAppendix‚Äù</a> of this message covers this information wrapped up in my
    witty banter around these issues if you are curious or confused and want to read more.
While I‚Äôm pretty confident this is the right stuff to do,
    I‚Äôm not claiming to have everything figured out.
I am, however, confident that these are some of the best known measures to protect yourself today.
If you have information that would compliment this message,
    or if I‚Äôve said something incorrect, please let me know so I can inform others.

Please pass this message along to anyone else that you think might benefit from this
    (especially those of you with bigger circles of influence)
    or help them if they need help and you can help them.
I‚Äôm personally happy to help out if anyone needs it so if someone
    is stumped ‚Äî and you trust me ‚Äî tell them to reach out.

<!-- No-Nonsense List of Steps -->
<h1 id="steps">No-Nonsense List of Steps</h1>

1. **Check your credit reports.**
Request here: [https://www.annualcreditreport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com).
I checked all three but you should at least check one.
It is free to request your credit report through the Annual Credit Report website once per year.
I recommend checking one report every four months (i.e., Equifax in September, TransUnion in January, Experian in May).
> If you find that your identity has been compromised, the FTC has [a page dedicated to the topic of identity theft](https://identitytheft.gov/), helping people report it and make a plan to recover from it.

2. **Freeze your credit.**
This blocks lenders from accessing your credit information without you explicitly lifting the freeze.
Thus, thieves cannot use your information to open new accounts.
> The Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) has [a page dedicated to the topic of credit freezing](http://www.uspirg.org/resources/usp/protect-yourself-against-new-account-id-theft) and how it is the only real way to ***prevent*** new account ID theft.

<!-- Appendix -->
<h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>

So you want to read more? Ok. Much of what is written here is a summary of this [CNET article][3], this [NY Times article][4], and this [krebsonsecurity article][5] which I‚Äôve found to be the most concise and useful. There is also an [extensive FAQ][6] from a highly acclaimed computer security reporter, Brian Krebs. I'm sure there is *a lot* of information out there at this point; the hard part is distilling it down to the bare minimum of information you need to know and the actions you should take - which is what I've tried to do here.

### Check your credit reports (recommended step #1)
Definitely do this (we did!).
Look for new credit cards, loans, reopened accounts, etc. (anything that you don‚Äôt recognize).
If you see something suspicious, report it ASAP;
    there is also a link in the CNET article linked above that takes you to guide to
    ‚Äúrecovering from identify theft.‚Äù

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires the three national credit reporting agencies to
    provide access to a free credit report once every 12 months.
To request your reports, try this link:
[https://www.annualcreditreport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com).

> **Credit Agencies:** There are actually four agencies! Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, and Innovis.
> See contact information for each of these agencies above.
>
> **Recommended Strategy:** Request 1 of your 3 credit reports every 4 months.
>
> **Potential Issue:** The same information is not reported to all credit reporting agencies necessarily.

Unfortunately because of the breach,
    you may enter your information to request a report only to get a
    ‚Äúsorry, we are experiencing high volumes due to the Equifax breach‚Äù
    message and be asked to try again later.
Try and try again.
Similarly, you may be asked to go through the process of printing off forms
    and mailing in identity/address information (ha!).
I guess at this point we are assuming that our SSNs and home addresses are already public,
    so why not send out another piece of mail that colocates this information?
I‚Äôd remain wary before following steps 2 and 3.

### Freeze your credit (recommended step #2)

A credit freeze ***prohibits*** companies from releasing your information for new inquiries.
There is cost associated with freezing, temporarily lifting, and permanently removing credit freezes.
The cost depends on the state in which you live.
For example, I currently live in New Hampshire and it costs $10.

> If you speak with the credit reporting agencies, they may try to talk you out of it.
> Freezing credit negatively affects their business model *and* creates more work for them.
> This is the absolute best thing that **you** can do to protect yourself.

We froze all our credit and we recommend (without hesitation) that you do to.
Even though it was only Equifax that was breached,
    it is quite possible for ‚Äúthe bad guys‚Äù to try to get loans, cards, etc. through the other credit bureaus (e.g., Experian, TransUnion) with the information that has been stolen.
Call all of them (or visit their websites) and freeze your credit.
Freezing your credit is the only way to prevent new credit accounts being created
    with your information.

When you freeze your credit,
    you‚Äôll get a PIN that allows you to unfreeze your account
    (so you can take out loans and what not in the future);
you‚Äôll need the PIN to unfreeze your credit in the future though,
    so write it down/store it somewhere safe
    (like a locked fire proof box at home...
        or make up a song to help remember them...
        something like that... üòÑ).
NOTE: If given a PIN, question them on how the PIN was created (if you can).
[There have already been rumors][7] that early PINs that were given out were generated
    based on the time/date that your credit was frozen. THIS IS NOT SECURE.

> I've seen references to this issue and it seems actions have been taken to address this.
> I remain skeptical though...

If possible, choose your own PIN and don‚Äôt base it on birthdays, anniversaries, etc., of loved ones.
You are going to write it down and put it in a safe place (right?!),
    so there is no need to make it easy to remember
    (you just need to remember where you put it for safe/secure keeping üòâ).

### Set up fraud alerts (recommended step #3; optional)
This is essentially just a note on your account that suggests there may have been
    suspicious activity with some account.
In a number of instances these have been shown to be ineffective.

Technically, with fraud alerts, businesses must verify identity before issuing credit.
The problem, however, is that not all do!
As I've been told, they are not required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
    to report in this way, so it is possible that fraud alerts can be ineffective.


<!--
There is a lot of speculation out there on how our breached information can and will be used
    in all sorts of creative ways
    (e.g., fraudulent medical claims,
        other fraudulent insurance claims,
        obtaining your tax returns).
Some issues can be addressed with credit freezing and fraud alerts;
    note that this is not a silver bullet and other issues may arise in the coming months/years.
-->

> After manually reviewing all of my credit reports and not seeing anything out of the ordinary (yay!), as well as freezing all of my credit accounts (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, and Innovis), I don't actually feel compelled to sign up for fraud alerts. This may still be a good option for you if you have concerns though.

### Set up banking alerts (recommended step #4; optional)
Since the most common form of identity theft is exploitation of *existing accounts*,
    a good way to notice suspicious activity for an existing account is to setup banking alerts.
For example, I bank with Bank of America and I have many alerts that I get via text
    and email when my credit card is used (as well as many other alerts because, hey, why not?).
If this is available to you, I recommend doing this as well.

### Identity theft
While there are many ways in which personal data can be used to commit identity theft,
the three most common types of identity theft are:

* Abuse of an existing account (e.g., existing credit cards. This is the most common form of identity theft!)
* Abuse of identity information to open new account (e.g., to open new lines of credit).
* Abuse of personal data (e.g., to file fraudulent tax refunds)

<!--
### Why an email? (originally)
There are many news articles and blogs out there that are commenting on what happened and what people should do.
Many of those people are more educated on these matters than I am so I do encourage you to seek them out ‚Äî I‚Äôve linked some in this message. I‚Äôm prone to read more of this stuff than the average person given my area of work, and I know many of you have varying levels of interest in the news, so I thought I‚Äôd reach out and share what I've learned.
I wrote an email because this breach is actually a big deal,
but I‚Äôm afraid many are hearing the news (or not hearing it at all) and thinking ‚Äúoh, just another hack‚Äù ‚Äî but this is quite different in that so many people were affected and the information that was leaked can be used to do virtually anything.

My hope is that a somewhat personal message from a family member or friend will prompt people to actually pay attention to this issue and take steps to protect themselves and those around them.   

### Parents
These issues don't necessarily apply to minors but you should consider whether or not it might make sense in your case to carry out the above prescribed actions on their behalf as well.
-->

### Enrolling in identity protection programs
Don't. At least not without first understanding the Terms of Service (TOS) and being OK with them.
Many people are pointing out that these agreements state that you can‚Äôt participate in class-action lawsuits if you use the various protection programs offered by the big credit bureaus (even if investigations reveal that Equifax was genuinely negligent or did something that made their data especially vulnerable).
It has also been observed that these programs are free for 1 year (for example) but then go into a subscription payment ($16.95/month or something along those lines).
There is much speculation that Equifax stands to profit off of this breach.

> I still feel these words of caution are relevant but I have seen more recent [sources][8] saying that the TOS has been updated for, e.g., Trusted ID (at least) and the arbitration clause is no longer included. In general, I tend to be wary of long documents with loads of legal jargon, so my advice is just to exercise caution when signing up for products being pushed to protect you (especially by the hacked companies themselves...). The intent behind this message is to express that there are things that ***you*** can do to protect yourself.

In addition, other sources that I trust suggest that these services are really just a bandaid of sorts and don't actually protect you, it just helps you become aware of an issue, but then you still have to deal with all of the fallout:
credit monitoring services aren‚Äôt really built to prevent ID theft. The most you can hope for from a credit monitoring service is that they give you a heads up when ID theft does happen, and then help you through the often labyrinthine process of getting the credit bureaus and/or creditors to remove the fraudulent activity and to fix your credit score.

### Watch for scams!

There have already been many reports of scams that attempt to get people to click links in
    email, texts, web advertisements, and so forth;
the context, of course, is that it is someone claiming to be from Equifax or a related firm,
    and the email contains information about programs for you to sign up for or ways to check if you've been affected.
Clicking these links may further compromise personal data or may be a mechanism to install malware.

> Equifax has claimed that they will only contact you if you contact them first.

<!--
Many students at Dartmouth, for example, received an email with a "secure PDF" attachment;
    the email sender claimed to be the President at Dartmouth! (But, of course, it was not!)
-->

<!--
As always, If you get alerts via email or text, don‚Äôt click on links (please!).
I suspect there will be a lot of phishing attempts in the wake of this breach (‚ÄúHi Travis, we‚Äôve noticed some unusual behavior in your recent credit history. In light of recent events, we have automatically enrolled all consumers into our free fraud detection program.
To log in and see the full report, click here.‚Äù   <<< probably a bad guy message!).
Go to your web browser and log into whichever account that way.
If the email provides phone numbers to use, don‚Äôt trust those either.
Look up the website online and look for contact information that way.
These are all tips that should be followed in general, but even more so in light of recent events. -->

### Tax returns
This is one of the most well-known ways that your information will be used against you.
Data frauds buy your identity information for cheap and then use that to file tax returns as soon as things open up.
**The best advice is to file as early as possibly to thwart this sort of misuse.**
We (Mary and I) are usually bad about this but I suspect we will try harder to file earlier this go around‚Ä¶

### Enable "2-Step Verification"
Sign up for "2-step verification" if your accounts offer them.
This essentially means that when you log in, you enter your password *in addition to*
    a unique security code that is sent to you via a pre-registered phone number or email address.

### Be vigilant before sharing your data
Before sharing your information, e.g., over the phone, ask:

* Why do you need it?
* How will it be used?
* How will they protect it?
* What happens if I don't share it?

### Opting out
To stop credit offer mailings, you can actually opt out!
Go to [www.optoutprescreen.com](www.optoutprescreen.com).

<!-- Questions -->
<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>

### Is credit monitoring or setting up fraud alerts really necessary?
A credit report **"lock"** is not a **"freeze"**.
While this is more convenient, it is potentially easier to circumvent than an actual credit freeze.

With respect to fraud alert products, the main benefit of products like "TrustedID Premier"
(as I understand) is the $1 million dollars of Identity Theft insurance they offer.
Note, however, that this is only free for one year.
After this point, you must pay a fee annually.

### What if I just cancel all my existing accounts and open new ones?
Sure, if you can, go for it.
Keep in mind, however, that these sorts of data breaches happen (the Equifax breach is just one example).
It could happen again!
Are you going to do these each and every time your information is breached?
Maybe. Probably not.
The right mentality is to assume your data is compromised and then take steps to protect yourself,
    such as freezing your credit and making it extremely difficult to arbitrarily unfreeze it for malicious purposes.

> I recently got a note from my bank that they were proactively issuing me a new card.
> They weren't saying that I had been compromised, but rather that I might have been and why wait
> for something to go wrong when issuing new cards is easy?
> I think this was a very classy move!

 <!-- Full disclosure & closing words -->
 <h1 id="conclusion">Full disclosure & closing words</h1>

 I completely admit that I don‚Äôt know how much of this stuff plays out.
 I‚Äôve spoken with some of my more mature contacts here (e.g., older friends and professors) and they‚Äôve done this stuff before.
 Freezing your credit does add more complexity for you later when you do want to open new credit cards, loans, and so forth.
 Better this, however, than having to dispute fraudulent accounts, and go through processes to restore your identity
 (which I‚Äôve heard can take years...).

 Again, please pass this message along to anyone else that you think might benefit from this, or help them if they need help and you can help them.
 I‚Äôm happy to help out if anyone needs it so if someone is stumped ‚Äî and you trust me ‚Äî tell them to reach out.
 I don‚Äôt have the email addresses for many family members or friends so please do forward this message/link to them or send me emails that I can follow up with.
 Also, If you have information that would compliment this page,
    or if I‚Äôve said something incorrect, please let me know so I can inform others.

 Any questions? Send them my way or ask a trusted friend.
 I don‚Äôt have all the answers but we can work together to figure it out! üòÑ
