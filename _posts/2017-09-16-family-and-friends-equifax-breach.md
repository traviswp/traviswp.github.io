Hi family and friends - 

I apologize for the length of the [message] that follows but if you’ve heard about the Equifax breach and haven’t done anything to protect yourself, please read on. 
I’ve been trying to sort out what Mary and I should do and as I compiled all of our actions I figured I’d share some notes in case anyone else hasn’t yet given this much thought. 
If you know about this issue (discussed in <a href="#problem">“What’s the Problem”</a> for those that have missed the news) and only want a simple description of what to do, skip down to the <a href="#steps">“No-Nonsense List of Steps.”</a> 
There is also an <a href="#appendix">“Appendix”</a> to this [message] (“what the heck, Travis, an appendix?!”) with more information for the curious reader. 
Again, sorry about the length but hopefully this is helpful to some...

<h1 id="problem">What’s the Problem?</h1>

You may have heard about the big [Equifax data breach][1]. 
Data that was stolen includes things like Social Security numbers, home addresses, credit card numbers, drivers license numbers and birth dates. 
The company estimates that the data of 143 million people were exposed, which is roughly half the US population. 
That means that the chances you are affected are pretty high. 
Even if you think you don’t have any affiliation with Equifax, you might. 
They have loads of information on loads of people. 
It is unclear who exactly has been “compromised," 
but given the scale of the breach and the value of the data, 
most people out there are saying its best to assume your data was included in the breached data and that this could really bite you at some point if you aren’t proactive now. 
Equifax released a tool that enabled people to check if they were affected but the tool is... not good. 
Indeed many sources online say something to the tune of: 
*"Equifax's hack checker seems to be broken. We recommend that anyone with a credit history assume they were affected"* [[CNET][2]].

What follows is a no-nonsense list of steps to take (this is what Mary and I are doing - take that for what it is worth). 
The <a href="#appendix">“Appendix”</a> of this [message] is this information plus extra information wrapped up in my witty banter around these issues if you are curious or confused. 
While I’m pretty confident this is the right stuff to do, I’m not claiming to have everything figured out. 
I am, however, confident that these are some of the best known measures to protect yourself today. 
If you have information that would compliment this [message], or if I’ve said something incorrect, 
please let me know so I can inform others.

Please pass this message along to anyone else that you think might benefit from this (especially those of you with bigger circles of influence :), or help them if they need help and you can help them. 
I’m happy to help out if anyone needs it so if someone is stumped — and you trust me — tell them to reach out. 
I don’t have the email addresses for many family members and friends so please do forward this message to them or send me emails that I can follow up with. 

Any questions? 
Send them my way or ask a trusted friend. 
I don’t have all the answers but we can work together to figure it out :D

<h1 id="steps">No-Nonsense List of Steps</h1>

1. **Check your credit reports.** 
Request here: [https://www.annualcreditreport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com). 
I checked all three but you should at least check one. 
It is free to request your credit report through the Annual Credit Report website once per year. 
I recommend checking one report every four months (i.e., Equifax in September, TransUnion in January, Experian in May).
2. **Freeze your credit.** This blocks lenders from accessing your credit information without you explicitly lifting the freeze. 
Thus, thieves cannot use your information to open new accounts.

3. **Setup fraud alerts.** Fraud alerts are temmporary (usually only 90 days) and only help you to notice when fraud has definitely been committed; in other words, it does not *prevent* fraud.

<h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>

So you want to read more? Ok. Much of what is written here is a summary of this [CNET article][3], this [NY Times article][4], and this [krebsonsecurity article][5] which I’ve found to be the most concise and useful. There is also an [extensive FAQ][6] from a highly acclaimed computer security reporter, Brian Krebs. 

### Check your credit reports (recommended step #1)
This is one thing we will be doing. Look for new credit cards, loans, reopened accounts, etc. (anything that you don’t recognize). If you see something suspicious, report it ASAP; there is also a link in the CNET article linked above that takes you to guide to “recovering from identify theft.”

You should be able to obtain a free credit report from each of the 3 major credit bureaus each year. Try this link: 
[https://www.annualcreditreport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com).

Unfortunately because of the breach, you may enter your information to request a report only to get a “sorry, we are experiencing high volumes due to the Equifax breach” message and be asked to try again later. Try and try again. Similarly, you may be asked to go through the process of printing off forms and mailing in identity/address information (ha!). I guess at this point we are assuming that our SSNs and home addresses are already public, so why not send out another piece of mail that colocates this information? I’d remain wary before following steps 2 and 3. At the time of writing this, I’ve only successfully obtained my credit report through Experian. 

### Freeze your credit (recommended step #2)
This is another thing we are doing (and what many people I’ve spoken with are doing). 
Even though it was only Equifax that was breached, it is quite possible for “the bad guys” to try to get loans, cards, etc. through the other credit bureaus (e.g., Experian, TransUnion) with the information that has been stolen. 
Call all of them (or visit their websites) and freeze your credit. 
You’ll get a PIN that allows you to unfreeze your account (so you can take out loans and what not in the future); 
you’ll need the PIN to unfreeze your credit in the future though, so write it down/store it somewhere safe (like a locked fire proof box at home...or make up a song to help remember them...something like that... :D). 
NOTE: If given a PIN, question them on how the PIN was created (if you can). 
[There have already been rumors][7] that early PINs that were given out were generated based on the time/date that your credit was frozen. THIS IS NOT SECURE. 

> I've seen references to this issue and it seems actions have been taken to address this. I remain skeptical though...

If possible, choose your own PIN and don’t base it on birthdays, anniversaries, etc., of loved ones. 
You are going to write it down and put it in a safe place (right?!) so no need to make it easy to remember 
(you just need to remember where you put it for safe/secure keeping :D). 

### Setup fraud alerts (recommended step #3; optional)
If you are paranoid like me (:D) why not freeze your credit and enable alerts when new activity happens. 
There is a lot of speculation out there on how this information can and will be used in all sorts of creative ways (e.g., fraudulent medical claims, other fraudulent insurance claims, obtaining your tax returns). 
Some issues can be addressed with credit freezing and fraud alerts; note that this is not a silver bullet though and other issues may arise in the coming months/years. 

> After manually reviewing all of my credit reports and not seeing anything out of the ordinary (yay!), as well as freezing all of my credit accounts (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, and Innovis), I don't actually feel compelled to sign up for fraud alerts. This may still be a good option for you if you have concerns though. 

As always, If you get alerts via email or text, don’t click on links (please!). 
I suspect there will be a lot of phishing attempts in the wake of this breach (“Hi Travis, we’ve noticed some unusual behavior in your recent credit history. In light of recent events, we have automatically enrolled all consumers into our free fraud detection program. 
To log in and see the full report, click here.”   <<< probably a bad guy message!). 
Go to your web browser and log into whichever account that way. 
If the email provides phone numbers to use, don’t trust those either. 
Look up the website online and look for contact information that way. 
These are all tips that should be followed in general, but even more so in light of recent events. 

### Why an email? (originally)
There are many news articles and blogs out there that are commenting on what happened and what people should do. 
Many of those people are more educated on these matters than I am so I do encourage you to seek them out — I’ve linked some in this message. I’m prone to read more of this stuff than the average person given my area of work, and I know many of you have varying levels of interest in the news, so I thought I’d reach out and share what I've learned. 
I wrote an email because this breach is actually a big deal, 
but I’m afraid many are hearing the news (or not hearing it at all) and thinking “oh, just another hack” — but this is quite different in that so many people were affected and the information that was leaked can be used to do virtually anything. 

My hope is that a somewhat personal message from a family member or friend will prompt people to actually pay attention to this issue and take steps to protect themselves and those around them.  

### Parents 
These issues apply to minors as well (anyone with an identity?) so you should carry out the above prescribed actions on their behalf. 

### Enrolling in identity protection programs 
Don't. At least not without first understanding the Terms of Service (TOS) and being OK with them. 
Many people are pointing out that these agreements state that you can’t participate in class-action lawsuits if you use the various protection programs offered by the big credit bureaus (even if investigations reveal that Equifax was genuinely negligent or did something that made their data especially vulnerable). 
It has also been observed that these programs are free for 1 year (for example) but then go into a subscription payment ($16.95/month or something along those lines). 
There is much speculation that Equifax stands to profit off of this breach. 

> I still feel these words of caution are relevant but I have seen more recent [sources][8] saying that the TOS has been updated for, e.g., Trusted ID (at least) and the arbitration clause is no longer included. In general, I tend to be wary of long documents with loads of legal jargon, so my advice is just to exercise caution when signing up for products being pushed to protect you (especially by the hacked companies themselves...). The intent behind this message is to express that there are things that ***you*** can do to protect yourself.

In addition, other sources that I trust suggest that these services are really just a bandaid of sorts and don't actually protect you, it just helps you become aware of an issue, but then you still have to deal with all of the fallout:
credit monitoring services aren’t really built to prevent ID theft. The most you can hope for from a credit monitoring service is that they give you a heads up when ID theft does happen, and then help you through the often labyrinthine process of getting the credit bureaus and/or creditors to remove the fraudulent activity and to fix your credit score. [krebsonsecurity]

### Tax returns
This is one of the most well-known ways that your information will be used against you. 
Data frauds buy your identity information for cheap and then use that to file tax returns as soon as things open up. 
The best advice is to file as early as possibly to thwart this sort of misuse. 
We (Mary and I) are usually bad about this but I suspect we will try harder to file earlier this go around…

### Full disclosure & closing words
I completely admit that I don’t know how much of this stuff plays out. 
I’ve spoken with some of my more mature contacts here (e.g., older friends and professors) and they’ve done this stuff before. 
Freezing your credit does add more complexity for you later when you do want to open new credit cards, loans, and so forth. 
Better this, however, than having to dispute fraudulent accounts, and go through processes to restore your identity 
(which I’ve heard can take years...). 

Again, please pass this message along to anyone else that you think might benefit from this, or help them if they need help and you can help them. 
I’m happy to help out if anyone needs it so if someone is stumped — and you trust me — tell them to reach out. 
I don’t have the email addresses for many family members or friends so please do forward this message to them or send me emails that I can follow up with. 
Also, If you have information that would compliment this email, or if I’ve said something incorrect, please let me know so I can inform others.

Any questions? Send them my way or ask a trusted friend. I don’t have all the answers but we can work together to figure it out :D
