I decided to write up my solutions for the
[Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
challenges ("wargames") from
[OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/).
There are surely a variety of other ways that the challenges can be solved.
I've tried especially hard to explain my actions and not take mysterious leaps
    with the hope that this write-up would actually be educational to those that spend time reading it,
    rather than simply a collection of "answers."

Throughout the wargame, the levels build on one another.
For example, to log in and do level 1, you need the password recovered from completing level 0.
In general, to attempt level N, use the ssh password from level (N-1).

Although it does not explicitly state so for these challenges,
I've learned from other related challenges that
*"data for the levels can be found in the homedirectories. You can look at /etc/bandit_pass for the various level passwords."*

While I'd like to think I'm super smart and can solve all of these by myself,
    the reality exists that I needed help sometimes due to ambiguity in the challenge, issues with the environment, and so forth.
I try my best to cite all of my sources where it is appropriate to do so.
At this point I forget exactly when, but at times I leaned on
[Alexander Clark’s Blog](https://alexandervoidstar.wordpress.com/category/overthewire-org/).

> **Spoiler Alert:**
*I include the passwords for the various levels in plaintext below.
The passwords are added as a comment at the end of the initial `ssh` login command for each level (an example of the format is included below).
I wrote them down this way for my own convenience and I'm not changing that here;
all of the passwords are probably out there somewhere if you really just want those.
From a pedagogical stand point, it is of no value to simply copy the passwords.
Work through the challenges, understand the techniques, learn the tools and creative thinking skills.
If you aren't doing it for that reason, then why oh why even spend time on these challenges?!*

```bash
#Login
ssh banditN@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=PASSWORD-FOR-LEVEL-N
```

The respective page for each of these challenges includes a description of the level as well as a list of commands that you may need to solve the level.
In some cases they may even provide hints or links to background information about the server environment which is needed.
I **will not** replicate that information here.
Instead, I will link to the relevant Bandit page and I'll assume that you are familiar with the goal of each level.
This has pros and cons but this is what I'm doing for now.

## [Level 0](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html) & [Level 1](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)

Level 0 is really just about logging into the Bandit server.
To log in to the first (zeroth) level, we use the provided password.
All that one needs to know here is how to use `ssh` to log into a remote server.
The `ssh` command that we use specifies a username (`bandit0`), a hostname (`bandit.labs.overthewire.org`) and a port (`-p 2220`);
    these eleemnts, combined with the provided password, can be put together to log in to the Bandit server to play the games.
That's all there is to it.

Before moving on, make sure you are comfortable with this command as we need it (with a different username/password)
to log in to each and every level for Over The Wire games.

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=bandit0
```

Once we are logged into the system we have begun level 1.
As the official page indicates (linked in the Level 1 title), we can use commands such as `ls` to list the contents of directories and `cd` to move between directories.
In this level, you should quickly notice the existence of a file named `readme`.
We can use the `cat` command to print the contents of the file to stdout (i.e., write the output to the terminal window).

```bash
$ cat readme
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
```

Great! Now we have the password for the next level.

## [Level 2](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)

We log into the bandit server as before, noting the difference in the username and password for this level.

```bash
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
```

We can again use the `cat` program to display the contents of the file.
You'll notice, however, that `cat -` doesn't get you what you want.
It turns out the `-` is a sort of "alias" for "stdin" which effectively means that when you type `cat -`,
the `cat` program is going to wait for information (e.g., filenames, written text) from the user before doing its usual job of writing out the content to stdout.
To communicate to `cat` more clearly that we want to address a file named `-` and not stdin,
simply prefix the filename with a relative path to the file `./-`.
The `./` prefix basically says "look in the current directory,"
So in the end, you are saying "look in the current directory for a file named '-'".

```bash
$ cat ./-
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
```

This is a useful insight to keep in mind in the future when dealing with funky filenames.

## [Level 3](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html)

We log into the bandit server as before, noting the difference in the username and password for this level
(I'll stop staying this in subsequent levels as I imagine you're getting more comfortable with this by now...).

```bash
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
```

In short, `cat` will treat words separated by spaces as if they are separate file names;
i.e., run `cat` on files named "space" and "in" and "this" and "filename".
If I have it straight, this is closer to what `cat` is *intended* to do: con**cat**enate files and output the result.
It just so happens that invoking `cat` on a single file concatenates it with nothing and then writes it out, which can be handy.

Anyhow, this challenge is meant to help us explore how to get `cat` to run on a single file where its name contains spaces.
The trick: "escape" the spaces!
Simply put, this prevents the shell from interpreting the space-separated words as separate arguments to feed to `cat` (pun intended?).
It is actually really easy if you start to write "cat sp" and then hit the tab character - it should auto-complete the line for you, escaping spaces appropriately.

```bash
$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

The astute hacker will notice that escaping characters such as spaces applies to other characters beyond spaces.
Stick that in your back pocket.

Alternatively, you could put quotation marks around the filename

```bash
$ cat "spaces in this filename"
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

Regardless of the approach, we get the password for the next level.
Apparently there are many ways to skin this `cat`... OK I'll stop.


















## [Level 4](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit4.html)

```bash
ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```
```bash
$ cat inhere/.hidden
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
```

## Level4 => Level5

```bash
$ ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
$ file inhere/* # output not shown here; the human readable file is “-file07” which has type “ASCII text”
$ cat inhere/-file07
koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
```

## Level5 => Level6

**NOTE:** The goal here is to find a file that is human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, and non executable.

```bash
$ ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
$ find  inhere/ -ls | grep 1033
  2269    4 -rw-r-----   1 root     bandit5      1033 Sep 16 07:10 inhere/maybehere07/.file2
```

This was the only file that was 1033 bytes in size… seems to easy… let’s check the file type.

```bash
$ file inhere/maybehere07/.file2
inhere/maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines
```

Everything seems to check out! Now get the password (some output trimmed because the end of the file was a little funky)

```bash
$ cat inhere/maybehere07/.file2
DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
```

## Level6 => Level7

```bash
$ ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
$ find / -ls -type f 2>&1 |  grep bandit7
  2280    4 -rw-r-----   1 bandit7  bandit6        33 Sep 16 07:10 /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
  4596    4 -r--------   1 bandit7  bandit7        33 Sep 16 07:10 /etc/bandit_pass/bandit7
  5749    4 drwxr-xr-x   2 bandit7  bandit7      4096 Sep 16 07:10 /home/bandit7
  5796 4088 -rw-r-----   1 bandit8  bandit7   4184396 Sep 16 07:10 /home/bandit7/data.txt
  5797    4 -rw-r--r--   1 bandit7  bandit7       675 Apr  9  2014 /home/bandit7/.profile
  5798    4 -rw-r--r--   1 bandit7  bandit7      3637 Apr  9  2014 /home/bandit7/.bashrc
  5799    4 -rw-r--r--   1 bandit7  bandit7       220 Apr  9  2014 /home/bandit7/.bash_logout
```

This is starting to get interesting.
The first part (find / -ls) says to search and LIST every file in the entire system! the (-type f) says to only select files (i.e., not directories, etc.). The (2>&1) keeps the annoying “Permission denied” messages from popping up during the traversal of the file system that find does. And last, the grep tries to identify the bandit7 string, which we are told identifies the user for the problem. We future verify that we’ve found the right file by noting that the file size is 33 bytes and the file belongs to the group bandit6.

```bash
$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

## Level7 => Level8

$ cat data.txt | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'
The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
```

## Level12 => Level13
NOTE: I referenced this StackOverflow post: How to detect the type of compression on the file?, which helped me identify that the file has a header that suggests the file has been compressed with Gzip (0x1f, 0x8b, 0x08)

```bash
$ ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
$ mkdir -p /tmp/t123
$ cd /tmp/123
$ cp ~/data.txt data
$ mv data data.hex
$ xxd -r data.hex data  # revert the hex dump to binary
$ file data  # confirms the compression type
data: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", from Unix, last modified: Sat Sep 16 07:10:14 2017, max compression
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/t123$ xxd data # double-check that the first few bytes match what we thought re: StackOverflow post.
0000000: 1f8b 0808 56ce bc59 0203 6461 7461 322e  ....V..Y..data2.
…snip…
```

NOTE: This was all followed by a repeated process of (1) checking the file types, (2) using “mv” to rename the file so that I could, (3) use decompress (gunzip or bunzip2) or unpack (tar -xvf) the file. For many iterations, the file was simply in yet another “form;” follow steps (1)-(3) until

```bash
$ file data8.bin
data8.bin: ASCII text
$ cat data8.bin

NOTE: Now we can use the openssl s_client as before to try to connect over SSL to the ports that are open. Some of them simply terminate the connection (because they aren’t running SSL and therefore my connection attempt is invalid). Some of them support SSL but are running an "echo server," which simply echoes anything you send to it. The bolded port above (31790) is the one that I found that was open, accepts SSL connections, -and- returns the secret for the next level. It actually returns an RSA key which I have not included here — you’ll have to log in as bandit16 (command above), use the openssl s_client command (bolded below), and retrieve the key yourself. I simply copy/pasted the key into a file called "sshkey.private" in the home directory and then used the ssh command (next level) to login as bandit17.

```bash
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31046 -ign_eof
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31518 -ign_eof
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31691 -ign_eof

```

In this level you must have two open connections, but this is not as straight forward as you might think because of the Over The Wire ssh infrastructure (described here). Fortunately that page provides some insightful information. We still need two terminals (respective snippets shown below). Here is the order in which commands should be executed:
1. In Terminal 2, create an SSH connection to the bandit game with port forwarding from localhost to the bandit server — a docker container.
2. In Terminal 1, create an SSH connection to localhost over the forwarded port — this connects you to the same docker container from step 1.
3. In Terminal 1, start a netcat server to listen for connections and keep an open connection.
4. In Terminal 2, use the “suconnect” script to connect on the netcat server created in step 3.
5. In Terminal 1, copy and paste the password for this level — the suconnect script will compare this password (which it receives over the connection to the netcat server running on localhost) and then send back the password for the next level.

Terminal 1:
```bash
$ ssh -l bandit20 -p 1234 localhost
…snip…
$ nc -l 55555
GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j   #<<< password for this level (level 20)
gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr   #<<< new password! (for level 21) — success!
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
$ ssh -l bandit20 -p 2220 -L 1234:localhost:22 bandit.labs.overthewire.org
…snip…
$ ./suconnect 55555

```

## Level23 => Level24

```bash
$ ssh bandit23@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n
$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
    echo "Handling $i"
    timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
    rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```

OK, so the cronjob simply executes all the scripts in the noted folder (where $myname = bandit24) and then deletes them. We can craft a small script and copy it to this directory. Note that this is possible because the folder is writable by anyone in group bandit23 (how convenient for us!). Our script (b23.sh) simply “cats” bandit24’s password to a file in /tmp/ which we can subsequently read. After composing our script, we change its permissions so that anyone executing the script does indeed have the necessarily permissions to do so; then copy the script to the directory noted above so that the cronjob executes it. Wait a few seconds and then check the tmp file that our script writes to. Voila!

```bash
=== b23.sh ===
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 >> /tmp/bandit24pass
==============
$ chmod 777 b23.sh
$ cp b23.sh /var/spool/bandit24/b23.sh
$ cat /tmp/bandit24pass
UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
```

## Level24 => Level25

```bash
$ ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
```

(1) use echo and bash expansions to construct strings with the password from the previous level (UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ)and every combination of 0..9 for each of the four PIN digits. (2) Piping this into tr yields repeating lines of our old password, then a PIN guess, then our old password, then another PIN guess, and so on. (3) Then using paste as we have, we “stitch” together two lines (i.e., so that our old password and one PIN guess reside on one line, separated by a single space. This part was a bit of a hack to get the text into the desired format. (4) The result of all of this is piped to the daemon running on localhost port 30002.

To be honest, my solution doesn’t show -which- “pin” reveals the correct answer, but it does print the correct answer to stdout.
Rumor has it that the PIN changes over time anyways, so who cares what the PIN is — we want the password!

```bash
$ echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ\ {0..9}{0..9}{0..9}{0..9} |  tr " " "\n" | paste -d ' ' - - | nc localhost 30002
...
Correct!
The password of user bandit25 is uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG
vs.
=== brute.sh ===
#!/bin/bash
echo "Bruteforcing port 30002:"
for i in $(seq 0000 9999);
do
echo "---------------"
echo "Testing: $i"
echo "---------------"
echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i | netcat localhost 30002
done
================
```

## Level25 => Level26

```bash
$ ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220   #password=uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG
$ ssh bandit26@localhost -i bandit26.sshkey
```

^^^ but we get logged out immediately… If you are watchful, you’ll notice that normal over-the-wire output is rendered, but at the end there is a “bandit 26” text that is also rendered. I wonder if this has something to do with the fact that bandit26 is using an irregular login shell… Logged in as bandit25, let’s see what bandit26 is running for its login shell (specified in the /etc/passwd file).

```bash
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
# And now let’s examine what this “showtext” script is doing.
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
# Aha, it runs more on the text.txt file in bandit26’s home directory.
# (The next bit is not necessarily straightforward, but bare with me here)
# Shrink the terminal to only a few lines tall (explanation for this below). Now try to log in again:
$ ssh bandit26@localhost -i bandit26.sshkey
# Type “v”
# Type “:r /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26”
# Now you’ll see the password appear:

```

**EXPLANATION:**
The login shell for bandit26 us the /usr/bin/showtext script shown above (not a traditional shell like bash, as the hint for this problem suggested). In the showtext script, the more command is used to display the content of the text.txt file. The more command provides “a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.” If the terminal screen is too big (i.e., displays more lines than there are lines of text in the ~/text.txt file), then more will print all of the content to the screen and “finish” (i.e., it has paged everything in the file given to more, so that command completes, and then the subsequent “exit 0” command is executed). The trick to this problem is to shrink the terminal screen so that more does not simply print the file contents and finish; rather, we want to keep the more process alive for a bit. By shrinking the terminal size, when “more ~/text.txt” is called, more does not finish because it is waiting for the user to continue paging/scrolling the content from the file. Thus, at this point, we are "sitting inside of” the more command and we can use its features — technically put, we are in the “interactive” mode of more.

As the man page reads for the more command, "interactive commands are based on vi". Thus, we press “v” to activate vi/vim-like input. Then, if you are a vi/vim user, you know that “:r” lets you read a file. At this point, we are running as bandit26 and we have the ability to read a file — so why not read a file that has the password? NOTE: For all of these challenges, the plaintext password for level N of the bandit challenges lives in /etc/bandit_pass/banditN. The issue is that you have to be running as user banditN to read the corresponding password file. Lucky, within our little vi environment within the process executing the more command, we are running as bandit26, so we can read the corresponding password file in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26.

As an aside, I think more will use the default editor if one is not specified in the environment variables. The EDITOR defaults to vi if neither VISUAL or EDITOR is defined (at least this is what I gleaned from the man page).



*At the time of working on these challenges, there is a page for Level 26 => Level 27, but no exercise has actually been created yet. Onto other challenges… :D*
