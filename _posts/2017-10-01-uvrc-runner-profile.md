# Town:

Hanover, NH (current)

# Where are you from originally and what brought you to this area?

Originally I’m from Florida, but in reality I’m from Washington state — a small town named Kelso to be precise. I went to college in Bellingham, Washington where I studied Mathematics and Computer Science. I moved to the Upper Valley to start graduate school at Dartmouth.

# What do you do professionally?

I’m a graduate student at Dartmouth, which basically means that I do research and at times help out with classes as a teaching assistant. Specifically, I do research in computer security and privacy. I work with others to examine ways that the computers and devices in our lives are weak and why they get “hacked” so that we (hopefully) can find ways to make them more secure and capable of preserving the privacy of their owners.

# How long have you been running?

I’ve been running since middle school – I started in 7th grade as a 400 meter runner / high jumper (my nickname was “Ghost” due to my humorously pale skin). I competed in Track & Field and Cross Country all the way through college. I was on a small hiatus from running for a couple of years but started getting back into it again about two years ago.

# Why do you run?

Sometimes I ask myself that very question! It is complicated… I used to feel quite ill before races and constantly battled my terrible inner running demons (“you’re not good enough,” “you’re not fast enough,” “you can’t do this” — real encouraging stuff). Part of the reason I kept doing it, to be honest, was simply habit; each year that passed where I kept at it made it that much harder to justify quitting. The real deal-maker for me was the friends and coaches. Even when running felt terrible, they were there. All of my best friends were runners. My coaches have all been incredibly inspiring and caring people that became pseudo-parent figures and people that I hope to be like some day. Even my wife (and absolute best friend) is a runner. See why I kept at it? Now that my ambitions of being a world-class middle-distance runner are behind me, I’ve enjoyed running a lot more! Anymore, running is about trying new things (like longer races) and staying encouraged with reminders such as “hey, I couldn’t do that last week (or month) — that’s progress!”

# Favorite post run treat?

Chocolate milk. No question.

# Hot or cold weather runner?

Cold! Hot weather and me… we don’t get along so well.

# Morning or evening runner?

Morning. I used to be an evening runner in high school and college, but now I find morning runs to be the most enjoyable. If I can manage to wake up early enough, I like running just before sunrise: the quite town streets, changing light, morning mist/dew, and cooler temperatures are all spectacular!

# I run therefore

I eat… and justify my sedentary habits of sitting in coffee shops and my office….

# Favorite running book/film?

[Once a Runner](https://www.amazon.com/Once-Runner-John-Parker-Jr/dp/1416597891) [by John L. Parker Jr.].
I didn’t read it until earlier this year.
It was AMAZING!
I can’t believe I didn’t read it sooner.
It will make you want to run a mile. FAST!
