Providing secure communications between wireless devices that encounter each other on an ad-hoc basis is a challenge that has not yet been fully addressed. In these cases, close physical proximity among devices that have never shared a secret key is sometimes used as a basis of trust; devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user’s device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques.We present theoretical and practical evaluation of a method called SNAP – SiNgle Antenna Proximity – that allows a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our proximity detection technique leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi’s preamble and the behavior of a signal in a transmitting antenna’s near-field region to detect proximity with high probability; SNAP never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.

Abstract
</button>
<div class="collapse well panel-body abstract-text-container">
Secure communication is difficult to arrange between devices that have not previously shared a secret. Previous solutions to the problem are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, require additional hardware for out-of-band communication, or require an extensive public-key infrastructure. Furthermore, as the number of wireless devices explodes with the advent of the Internet of Things, it will be impractical to manually configure each device to communicate with its neighbors or with the local WLAN.Our system, <em>CloseTalker</em>CloseTalker, allows simple, secure, ad hoc communication between devices in close physical proximity, while jamming the signal so it is unintelligible to any receivers more than a few centimeters away. CloseTalker does not require any specialized hardware or sensors in the devices, does not require complex algorithms or cryptography libraries, occurs only when intended by the user, and can transmit a short burst of data or an address and key that can be used to establish long-term or long-range communications at full bandwidth.In this paper we present a theoretical and practical evaluation of CloseTalker, which exploits Wi-Fi MIMO antennas and the fundamental physics of radio to establish secure communication between devices that have never previously met. We demonstrate that CloseTalker is able to facilitate secure in-band communication between devices in close physical proximity (about 5 cm), even though they have never met nor shared a key.

This paper presents work towards realizing architectural support for Bluetooth Trusted I/O on SGX-enabled platforms, with the goal of providing I/O data protection that does not rely on system software security. Indeed, we are primarily concerned with protecting I/O from all software adversaries, including privileged software. In this paper we describe the challenges in designing and implementing Trusted I/O at the architectural level for Bluetooth. We propose solutions to these challenges. In addition, we describe our proof-of-concept work that extends existing over-the-air Bluetooth security all the way to an SGX enclave by securing user data between the Bluetooth Controller and an SGX enclave.

The homes, offices, and vehicles of tomorrow will be embedded with numerous “Smart Things,” networked with each other and with the Internet. Many of these Things are embedded in the physical infrastructure, and like the infrastructure they are designed to last for decades – far longer than is normal with today’s electronic devices. What happens then, when an occupant moves out or transfers ownership of her Smart Environment? This paper outlines the critical challenges required for the safe long-term operation of Smart Environments. How does an occupant identify and decommission all the Things in an environment before she moves out? How does a new occupant discover, identify, validate, and configure all the Things in the environment he adopts? When a person moves from smart home to smart office to smart hotel, how is a new environment vetted for safety and security, how are personal settings migrated, and how are they securely deleted on departure? When the original vendor of a Thing (or the service behind it) disappears, how can that Thing (and its data, and its configuration) be transferred to a new service provider? What interface can enable lay people to manage these complex challenges, and be assured of their privacy, security, and safety? We present a list of key research questions to address these important challenges.

Mobile and wearable systems have generated unprecedented interest in recent years, particularly in the domain of mobile health (mHealth) where carried or worn devices are used to collect health-related information about the observed person. Much of the information – whether physiological, behavioral, or social – collected by mHealth systems is sensitive and highly personal; it follows that mHealth systems should, at the very least, be deployed with mechanisms suitable for ensuring confidentiality of the data it collects. Additional properties – such as integrity of the data, source authentication of data, and data freshness – are also desirable to address other security, privacy, and safety issues. Developing systems that are robust against capable adversaries (including physical attacks) is, and has been, an active area of research. While techniques for protecting systems that handle sensitive data are well-known today, many of the solutions in use today are not well suited for mobile and wearable systems, which are typically limited with respect to power, memory, computation, and other capabilities. In this paper we look at prior research on developing trustworthy mobile and wearable systems. To survey this topic we begin by discussing solutions for securing computing systems that are not subject to the type of strict constraints associated with mobile and wearable systems. Next, we present other efforts to design and implement trustworthy mobile and wearable systems. We end with a discussion of future directions.

Wearable technology enables a range of exciting new applications in health, commerce, and beyond. For many important applications, wearables must have battery life measured in weeks or months, not hours and days as in most current devices. Our vision of wearable platforms aims for long battery life but with the flexibility and security to support multiple applications. To achieve long battery life with a workload comprising apps from multiple developers, these platforms must have robust mechanisms for app isolation and developer tools for optimizing resource usage.We introduce the Amulet Platform for constrained wearable devices, which includes an ultra-low-power hardware architecture and a companion software framework, including a highly efficient event-driven programming model, low-power operating system, and developer tools for profiling ultra-low-power applications at compile time. We present the design and evaluation of our prototype Amulet hardware and software, and show how the framework enables developers to write energy-efficient applications. Our prototype has battery lifetime lasting weeks or even months, depending on the application, and our interactive resource-profiling tool predicts battery lifetime within 6-10% of the measured lifetime.

In this demonstration we present the Amulet Platform; a hardware and software platform for developing energy- and resource-efficient applications on multi-application wearable devices. This platform, which includes the Amulet Firmware Toolchain, the Amulet Runtime, the ARP-View graphical tool, and open reference hardware, efficiently protects applications from each other without MMU support, allows developers to interactively explore how their implementation decisions impact battery life without the need for hardware modeling and additional software development, and represents a new approach to developing long-lived wearable applications. We envision the Amulet Platform enabling long-duration experiments on human subjects in a wide variety of studies.

In this work we conduct a survey of the Internet of Things, primarily focused around identifying security, privacy, and safety concerns in consumer-centric scenarios (e.g., SmartHealthcare, SmartHomes, SmartCars). Our primary goal in this work is to identify gaps in the security and threat models that are being considered today in order to gain insight into what needs to be done in the future to ensure the security of our interconnected things. To begin to try to understand the threats in the IoT we began by first trying to understand the usages, technologies, and standards that are driving the adoption of IoT.

The role of securing I/O data is generally understood to be a responsibility of a modern OS. This is, however, inherently assuming that we trust the OS and the various drivers that handle I/O data with potentially sensitive information. Of particular interest in I/O data security is the security of input data for authentication such as passwords and PINs, as well as other sensitive information that is entered in popular applications including, but not limited to, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and credit/debit card information. When input data is entered via a Bluetooth Human Interface Device (HID) such as a keyboard, this data is secured over the air, however, upon arriving in the Bluetooth Controller of the host machine, the data is decrypted and passed up through various drivers in the OS before ultimately reaching an application. Trusted I/O (TIO) for Bluetooth devices aims to secure data between a Trusted Application (e.g., an application running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)) and the Bluetooth Controller which receives Bluetooth data over the air. In this document, I will present some of the challenges that must be addressed in implementing TIO for Bluetooth devices, review our plan for a firmware-based approach to cryptographically protecting Bluetooth keyboard input data and our actual Proof of Concept work which (1) implements an interface by which a Trusted Application can program/clear a TIO session key into the Bluetooth Controller, (2) modifies the Bluetooth Controller’s firmware to maintain TIO-related connection information for connected devices, and (3) modifies the firmware to implement L2CAP-level packet parsing to identify packets containing HID Report data and encrypt the data if a TIO session has been enabled for that device. I will close with an overview of remaining challenges and future work.

Interest in using mobile technologies for health-related applications (mHealth) has increased. However, none of the available mobile platforms provide the essential properties that are needed by these applications. An mHealth platform must be (i) secure; (ii) provide high availability; and (iii) allow for the deployment of multiple third-party mHealth applications that share access to an individual’s devices and data. Smartphones may not be able to provide property (ii) because there are activities and situations in which an individual may not be able to carry them (e.g., while in a contact sport). A low-power wearable device can provide higher availability, remaining attached to the user during most activities. Furthermore, some mHealth applications require integrating multiple on-body or near-body devices, some owned by a single individual, but others shared with multiple individuals. In this paper, we propose a secure system architecture for a low-power bracelet that can run multiple applications and manage access to shared resources in a body-area mHealth network. The wearer can install a personalized mix of third-party applications to support the monitoring of multiple medical conditions or wellness goals, with strong security safeguards. Our preliminary implementation and evaluation supports the hypothesis that our approach allows for the implementation of a resource monitor on far less power than would be consumed by a mobile device running Linux or Android. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that our secure architecture would enable applications to run for several weeks on a small wearable device without recharging.

Wearable devices of all kinds are becoming increasingly popular. One problem that plagues wearable devices, however, is how to interact with them. In this paper we construct a prototype electromyography (EMG) sensing device that captures a single channel of EMG sensor data corresponding to user gestures. We also implement a machine learning pipeline to recognize gestural input received via our prototype sensing device. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of using a BITalino EMG sensor to recognize gestural input on a mobile health (mHealth) wearable device known as Amulet. We conduct three experiments in which we use the EMG sensor to collect gestural input data from (1) the wrist, (2) the forearm, and (3) the bicep. Our results show that a single channel EMG sensor located near the wrist may be a viable approach to reliably recognizing simple gestures without mistaking them for common daily activities such as drinking from a cup, walking, or talking while moving your arms.

We develop a model to schedule trips down the Big Long River. The goal is to optimally plan boat trips of varying duration and propulsion so as to maximize the number of trips over the six-month season. We model the process by which groups travel from campsite to campsite. Subject to the given constraints, our algorithm outputs the optimal daily schedule for each group on the river. By studying the algorithm’s long-term behavior, we can compute a maximum number of trips, which we define as the river’s carrying capacity. We apply our algorithm to a case study of the Grand Canyon, which has many attributes in common with the Big Long River. Finally, we examine the carrying capacity’s sensitivity to changes in the distribution of propulsion methods, distribution of trip duration, and the number of campsites on the river.
