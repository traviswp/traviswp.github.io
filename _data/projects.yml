         in our work we experimented with a system capable of communicating over audio (ultrasonic), radio (Bluetooth), and visible Light (w/ LEDs, based on OpenVLC) channels, assuming that all of the relevant transmit/receive hardware co-exists on a single platform.
         PEARL, at its core, is meant to present an abstraction of the comunication technologies implemented in the underlying system.
         The abstraction enables application and system developers to focus more on -what- data is communicated, while delegating the responsibility of figuring our -how- to best communicate with other devices to the system itself."

         One problem that plagues wearable devices, however, is how to interact with them.
         In research I conducted in my first year at Dartmouth, we constructed a prototype electromyography (EMG) sensing device that captures a single channel of EMG sensor data corresponding to user gestures.
         In our work we implemented a machine learning pipeline to recognize gestural input received via our prototype sensing device.
         We assessed the feasibility of this input modality using a BITalino EMG sensor to recognize gestural input on a mobile health (mHealth) wearable device known as Amulet (see related projects and papers above).
         We conducted experiments in which we used the EMG sensor to collect gestural input data from (1) the wrist, (2) the forearm, and (3) the bicep.
         Our results show that a single channel EMG sensor located near the wrist may be a viable approach to reliably recognizing simple gestures without mistaking them for common daily activities such as drinking from a cup, walking, or talking while moving your hands and arms.

- title: "Facial Recognition"
  desc: "In a computer vision class project, I worked with Haider Syed to build FaceID.
         Our project was inspired by work being done in the mHealth Security & Privacy lab to address authentication with a mobile medical device.
         Some of the members of the lab were working with students from another school to construct a low-cost, mobile device known as a Spirometer with a camera installed on it.
         The camera was supposed to be used to take a picture of the person using the Spirometer at the time of use and verify that that person is a known user for the device;
         properly identifying a person would also record any session data into, for example, a medical record.
         Thus, our project was an effort towards building the facial recognition component.
         The real challenge in this work is building a facial recognition system that can perform well even when the person's face is occluded by an object (e.g., a Spirometer).
         We designed and built a system that could identify the face and segment it from the baground, extract feature descriptors, and use a nearest-neighbor classifier to perform recognition.
         We tested our methods on the Faces in the Wile database."

- title: "Protein Loop Structure Prediction"
  desc: "In a bioinformatics class project, I worked with Ryan Amos and Serena Liu to build a protein structure prediction algorithm.
         Protein structure is known to inform protein function; thus, knowledge of a protein’s 3D structure helps in predicting its biological function.
         Protein loops are defined as the amino acid stretches between secondary structure elements (SSEs), such as alpha helices or beta pleated sheets.
         Loop structures are highly variable and more flexible than SSE structures;
         some loops do not have a single fixed structure and may undergo conformational changes that impact their protein’s overall function.
         Although loops play an important role in protein function, loop structures remain difficult to predict because of their irregularity and variability.
         Previous research into loop structure prediction has generally taken one of two approaches (described in detail in our paper).
         Our work is most similar to the second approach: database search.
         Specifically, our project aims to implement a database search algorithm to predict loop structure given a protein loop sequence.
         Most loops contain between 7 and 9 amino acids, so in our work we focus on classifying loops within this length range.
         (NOTE: While I prefer to compose papers in LaTeX and generate nice PDFs, we wrote this paper using Microsoft Word. The converted PDF is provided for convenience but it looks horrific. I recommend reading the .doc version.)"

- title: "Computing Along the Big Long River: A River Rafting Simulator"
  desc: "While I was taking a mathematical modeling class, Chip Jackson, Lucas Bourne, and myself formed a team (advised by Dr. Edoh Amiran) to compete in a the Mathematical Contest in Modeling.
         In our submission, we develop a model to schedule trips down the Big Long River.
         The goal is to optimally plan boat trips of varying duration and propulsion so as to maximize the number of trips over the six-month season.
         We model the process by which groups travel from campsite to campsite.
         Subject to the given constraints, our algorithm outputs the optimal daily schedule for each group on the river.
         By studying the algorithm’s long-term behavior, we can compute a maximum number of trips, which we define as the river’s carrying capacity.
         We apply our algorithm to a case study of the Grand Canyon, which has many attributes in common with the Big Long River.
         Finally, we examine the carrying capacity’s sensitivity to changes in the distribution of propulsion methods, distribution of trip duration, and the number of campsites on the river.
         In this contest students are challenged to clarify, analyze, and propose solutions to open-ended problems.
         To our surprise, our paper was selected as an Outstanding Winner in the competition, and we received the Frank Giordano award.
         The contest included over 3,600 teams from 17 countries around the world.

         In the paper I argue that our effots towards solving security problems, which often result directly from developments in mathematics and computing technologies, will inevitably equip attackers with both the tools and knowledge necessary to overcome the solutions we work so hard to realize.
         In turn, I posit, a vicious cycle is created that will eternally prevent the advent of truly dependable security of information."
