         These devices coordinate the activity of the body-area network and provide a discreet means for communicating with their wearer.
         Such devices complement the capabilities of a smartphone, bridging the gap between the type of pervasive computing possible with a mobile phone and that enabled by wearable computing.
         For more information, see our papers above."

         PEARL: a first of its kind communication system that enabled simultaneous communication channels between physically co-located peers via diverse communication channels;
         in our work we experimented with a system capable of communicating over audio (ultrasonic), radio (Bluetooth), and visible Light (w/ LEDs, based on OpenVLC) channels, assuming that all of the relevant transmit/receive hardware co-exists on a single platform.
         PEARL, at its core, is meant to present an abstraction of the comunication technologies implemented in the underlying system.
         The abstraction enables application and system developers to focus more on -what- data is communicated, while delegating the responsibility of figuring our -how- to best communicate with other devices to the system itself."

         My objective in this project was to study Android and Binder along with syscall fuzzing in order to learn more about Android, Binder IPC, and vulnerability detection and analysis.
         Our study was further concentrated on the ioctl() syscall due to the significant role is plays in handling Binder data and the potential for abuse/misuse.
         In the paper, I presented some of my findings and reviewed fuzzing frameworks.
         I also experimented with running Trinity-based fuzzing tools and share some of my insights."

         If successful, some form of intervention may be possible;
         for example, if oncoming craving were detected, the wearer of the appropriate sensor could be alerted via their smartphone which could then help them avoid a potentially challenging situation where they may be tempted to smoke."

         We accomplish this by providing a friendly interface that allows tutors and tutees to specify information about themselves and what they are looking for, search for and connect with others, as well as reserve a space for their tutor/tutee sessions."

- title: "Electromyography-based Gesture Recognition"
  desc: "Wearable devices of all kinds are becoming increasingly popular.
         One problem that plagues wearable devices, however, is how to interact with them.
         In research I conducted in my first year at Dartmouth, we constructed a prototype electromyography (EMG) sensing device that captures a single channel of EMG sensor data corresponding to user gestures.
         In our work we implemented a machine learning pipeline to recognize gestural input received via our prototype sensing device.
         We assessed the feasibility of this input modality using a BITalino EMG sensor to recognize gestural input on a mobile health (mHealth) wearable device known as Amulet (see related projects and papers above).
         We conducted experiments in which we used the EMG sensor to collect gestural input data from (1) the wrist, (2) the forearm, and (3) the bicep.
         Our results show that a single channel EMG sensor located near the wrist may be a viable approach to reliably recognizing simple gestures without mistaking them for common daily activities such as drinking from a cup, walking, or talking while moving your hands and arms.

- title: "Facial Recognition"
  desc: "In a computer vision class project, I worked with Haider Syed to build FaceID.
         Our project was inspired by work being done in the mHealth Security & Privacy lab to address authentication with a mobile medical device.
         Some of the members of the lab were working with students from another school to construct a low-cost, mobile device known as a Spirometer with a camera installed on it.
         The camera was supposed to be used to take a picture of the person using the Spirometer at the time of use and verify that that person is a known user for the device;
         properly identifying a person would also record any session data into, for example, a medical record.
         Thus, our project was an effort towards building the facial recognition component.
         The real challenge in this work is building a facial recognition system that can perform well even when the person's face is occluded by an object (e.g., a Spirometer).
         We designed and built a system that could identify the face and segment it from the baground, extract feature descriptors, and use a nearest-neighbor classifier to perform recognition.
         We tested our methods on the Faces in the Wile database."

- title: "Protein Loop Structure Prediction"
  desc: "In a bioinformatics class project, I worked with Ryan Amos and Serena Liu to build a protein structure prediction algorithm.
         Protein structure is known to inform protein function; thus, knowledge of a protein’s 3D structure helps in predicting its biological function.
         Protein loops are defined as the amino acid stretches between secondary structure elements (SSEs), such as alpha helices or beta pleated sheets.
         Loop structures are highly variable and more flexible than SSE structures;
         some loops do not have a single fixed structure and may undergo conformational changes that impact their protein’s overall function.
         Although loops play an important role in protein function, loop structures remain difficult to predict because of their irregularity and variability.
         Previous research into loop structure prediction has generally taken one of two approaches (described in detail in our paper).
         Our work is most similar to the second approach: database search.
         Specifically, our project aims to implement a database search algorithm to predict loop structure given a protein loop sequence.
         Most loops contain between 7 and 9 amino acids, so in our work we focus on classifying loops within this length range.
         (NOTE: While I prefer to compose papers in LaTeX and generate nice PDFs, we wrote this paper using Microsoft Word. The converted PDF is provided for convenience but it looks horrific. I recommend reading the .doc version.)"

         rather than getting hung-up in more complex development environments like Visual Studio, but still providing helpful tools such as project management guidance, basic text editor features, syntax highlighting, etc...
         The project was originally proposed by other students and later picked up by Travis Peters, Michael McAallister, and Christopher Proteau in CSCI 493 (Software Implementation) in the Fall of 2012 at Western Washington University."
