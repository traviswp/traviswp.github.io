  TITLE: Proximity Detection with Single-Antenna IoT Devices
  abstract: Providing secure communications between wireless devices thatencounter
    each other on an ad-hoc basis is a challenge that has not yet beenfully addressed.
    In these cases, close physical proximity among devices thathave never shared a
    secret key is sometimes used as a basis of trust; devicesin close proximity are
    deemed trustworthy while more distant devices areviewed as potential adversaries.
    Because radio waves are invisible, however,a user may believe a wireless device
    is communicating with a nearby devicewhen in fact the user's device is communicating
    with a distant adversary.Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna
    devices toascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a
    singleantenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot takeadvantage
    of these techniques. <br/><br/> We present theoretical and practicalevaluation
    of a method called SNAP -- SiNgle Antenna Proximity -- that allowsa single-antenna
    Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with anotherWi-Fi device. Our proximity
    detection technique leverages the repeatingnature Wi-Fi's preamble and the behavior
    of a signal in a transmittingantenna's near-field region to detect proximity with
    high probability; SNAPnever falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14cm.

  TITLE: 'CloseTalker: secure, short-range ad hoc wireless communication'
  abstract: Secure communication is difficult to arrange between devices thathave
    not previously shared a secret. Previous solutions to the problem aresusceptible
    to man-in-the-middle attacks, require additional hardware forout-of-band communication,
    or require an extensive public-key infrastructure.Furthermore, as the number of
    wireless devices explodes with the advent ofthe Internet of Things, it will be
    impractical to manually configure eachdevice to communicate with its neighbors
    or with the local WLAN. <br/><br/> Oursystem, CloseTalker, allows simple, secure,
    ad hoc communicationbetween devices in close physical proximity, while jamming
    the signal so itis unintelligible to any receivers more than a few centimeters
    away.CloseTalker does not require any specialized hardware or sensors in thedevices,
    does not require complex algorithms or cryptography libraries,occurs only when
    intended by the user, and can transmit a short burst of dataor an address and
    key that can be used to establish long-term or long-rangecommunications at full
    bandwidth. <br/><br/> In this paper we present a theoreticaland practical evaluation
    of CloseTalker, which exploits Wi-Fi MIMO antennasand the fundamental physics
    of radio to establish secure communicationbetween devices that have never previously
    met. We demonstrate thatCloseTalker is able to facilitate secure in-band communication
    betweendevices in close physical proximity (about 5cm), even though they have
    nevermet nor shared a key.

  abstract: This paper presents work towards realizing architectural supportfor Bluetooth
    Trusted I/O on SGX-enabled platforms, with the goal ofproviding I/O data protection
    that does not rely on system software security.Indeed, we are primarily concerned
    with protecting I/O from all softwareadversaries, including privileged software.
    In this paper we describe thechallenges in designing and implementing Trusted
    I/O at the architecturallevel for Bluetooth. We propose solutions to these challenges.
    In addition,we describe our proof-of-concept work that extends existing over-the-airBluetooth
    security all the way to an SGX enclave by securing user databetween the Bluetooth
    Controller and an SGX enclave.

  TITLE: Challenges to ensuring human safety throughout the life-cycle of Smart Environments
  abstract: The homes, offices, and vehicles of tomorrow will be embeddedwith numerous
    ``Smart Things,'' networked with each other and with theInternet. Many of these
    Things are embedded in the physical infrastructure,and like the infrastructure
    they are designed to last for decades -- farlonger than is normal with today's
    electronic devices. What happens then,when an occupant moves out or transfers
    ownership of her Smart Environment?This paper outlines the critical challenges
    required for the safe long-termoperation of Smart Environments. How does an occupant
    identify anddecommission all the Things in an environment before she moves out?
    How doesa new occupant discover, identify, validate, and configure all the Things
    inthe environment he adopts? When a person moves from smart home to smartoffice
    to smart hotel, how is a new environment vetted for safety andsecurity, how are
    personal settings migrated, and how are they securelydeleted on departure? When
    the original vendor of a Thing (or the servicebehind it) disappears, how can that
    Thing (and its data, and itsconfiguration) be transferred to a new service provider?
    What interface canenable lay people to manage these complex challenges, and be
    assured of theirprivacy, security, and safety? We present a list of key research
    questions toaddress these important challenges.

  TITLE: A Survey of Trustworthy Computing on Mobile & Wearable Systems
  abstract: Mobile and wearable systems have generated unprecedented interest in recent
    years,particularly in the domain of mobile health (mHealth) where carried or worn
    devices are used to collect health-related information about the observed person.Much
    of the information -- whether physiological, behavioral, or social -- collected
    by mHealth systems is sensitive and highly personal;it follows that mHealth systems
    should, at the very least, be deployed with mechanisms suitable for ensuring confidentiality
    of the data it collects.Additional properties -- such as integrity of the data,
    source authentication of data, and data freshness -- are also desirable to address
    other security, privacy, and safety issues.Developing systems that are robust
    against capable adversaries (including physical attacks) is,and has been, an active
    area of research. While techniques for protecting systems that handle sensitive
    data are well-known today,many of the solutions in use today are not well suited
    for mobile and wearable systems,which are typically limited with respect to power,
    memory, computation, and other capabilities.In this paper we look at prior research
    on developing trustworthy mobile and wearable systems.To survey this topic we
    begin by discussing solutions for securing computing systems that are not subject
    to thetype of strict constraints associated with mobile and wearable systems.Next,
    we present other efforts to design and implement trustworthy mobile and wearable
    systems.We end with a discussion of future directions.

  TITLE: 'Amulet: An Energy-Efficient, Multi-Application Wearable Platform'
  abstract: Wearable technology enables a range of exciting new applicationsin health,
    commerce, and beyond. For many important applications, wearablesmust have battery
    life measured in weeks or months, not hours and days as inmost current devices.
    Our vision of wearable platforms aims for long batterylife but with the flexibility
    and security to support multiple applications.To achieve long battery life with
    a workload comprising apps from multipledevelopers, these platforms must have
    robust mechanisms for app isolation anddeveloper tools for optimizing resource
    usage. <br/><br/> We introduce the AmuletPlatform for constrained wearable devices,
    which includes an ultra-low-powerhardware architecture and a companion software
    framework, including a highlyefficient event-driven programming model, low-power
    operating system, anddeveloper tools for profiling ultra-low-power applications
    at compile time.We present the design and evaluation of our prototype Amulet hardware
    andsoftware, and show how the framework enables developers to writeenergy-efficient
    applications. Our prototype has battery lifetime lastingweeks or even months,
    depending on the application, and our interactiveresource-profiling tool predicts
    battery lifetime within 6-10% of themeasured lifetime.

  TITLE: 'Amulet: A secure architecture for mHealth applications for low-power wearable
    devices'
  abstract: Interest in using mobile technologies for health-relatedapplications (mHealth)
    has increased. However, none of the available mobileplatforms provide the essential
    properties that are needed by theseapplications. An mHealth platform must be (i)
    secure; (ii) provide highavailability; and (iii) allow for the deployment of multiple
    third-partymHealth applications that share access to an individual's devices and
    data.Smartphones may not be able to provide property (ii) because there areactivities
    and situations in which an individual may not be able to carrythem (e.g., while
    in a contact sport). A low-power wearable device canprovide higher availability,
    remaining attached to the user during mostactivities. Furthermore, some mHealth
    applications require integratingmultiple on-body or near-body devices, some owned
    by a single individual, butothers shared with multiple individuals. In this paper,
    we propose a securesystem architecture for a low-power bracelet that can run multipleapplications
    and manage access to shared resources in a body-area mHealthnetwork. The wearer
    can install a personalized mix of third-partyapplications to support the monitoring
    of multiple medical conditions orwellness goals, with strong security safeguards.
    Our preliminaryimplementation and evaluation supports the hypothesis that our
    approachallows for the implementation of a resource monitor on far less power
    thanwould be consumed by a mobile device running Linux or Android. Ourpreliminary
    experiments demonstrate that our secure architecture would enableapplications
    to run for several weeks on a small wearable device withoutrecharging.

  TITLE: An Assessment of Single-Channel EMG Sensing for Gestural Input
  abstract: Wearable devices of all kinds are becoming increasingly popular.One problem
    that plagues wearable devices, however, is how to interact with them.In this paper
    we construct a prototype electromyography (EMG) sensing device that captures a
    single channel of EMG sensor data corresponding to user gestures.We also implement
    a machine learning pipeline to recognize gestural input received via our prototype
    sensing device.Our goal is to assess the feasibility of using a BITalino EMG sensor
    to recognize gestural input on a mobile health (mHealth) wearable device known
    as Amulet.We conduct three experiments in which we use the EMG sensor to collect
    gestural input data from (1) the wrist, (2) the forearm, and (3) the bicep.Our
    results show that a single channel EMG sensor located near the wrist may be a
    viable approach to reliably recognizing simple gestureswithout mistaking them
    for common daily activities such as drinking from a cup, walking, or talking while
    moving your arms.

  TITLE: Computing Along the Big Long River
  abstract: "We develop a model to schedule trips down the Big Long River.The goal\
    \ is to optimally plan boat trips of varying duration and propulsion so as to\
    \ maximize the number of trips over the six-month season.We model the process\
    \ by which groups travel from campsite to campsite. Subject to the given constraints,\
    \ our algorithm outputs the optimal daily schedule for each group on the river.By\
    \ studying the algorithm\u2019s long-term behavior, we can compute a maximum number\
    \ of trips, which we define as the river\u2019s carrying capacity.We apply our\
    \ algorithm to a case study of the Grand Canyon, which has many attributes in\
    \ common with the Big Long River.Finally, we examine the carrying capacity\u2019\
    s sensitivity to changes in the distribution of propulsion methods, distribution\
    \ of trip duration, and the number of campsites on the river."
