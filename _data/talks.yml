  abstract: "To truly understand C, and in particular, the use of pointers, you need to understand how C programs use memory. These same concepts underly nearly all procedural languages, though some languages cover up the details."
# Professor David Kotz
  # Goals:
  # 1. to recognize that all data is stored in memory, that memory is a linear sequence of bytes, and that every byte has a numeric address.
  # 2. to understand that C stores all data in one of three areas of memory, each managed differently.
  # 3. to understand how these memory concepts relate to concepts about name scope
